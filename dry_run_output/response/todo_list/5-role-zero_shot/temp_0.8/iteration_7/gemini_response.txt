Of course. As a senior software developer, I will create a high-quality, maintainable, and well-documented Python application for a console-based todo list. The solution will adhere to the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard, focusing on maintainability, performance efficiency, reliability, and usability.

The implementation will use a `TaskManager` class to encapsulate the core logic, separated from the user interface. A dictionary will be used for in-memory storage to ensure efficient O(1) average-case time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions by ID.

Here is the complete solution:

```python
