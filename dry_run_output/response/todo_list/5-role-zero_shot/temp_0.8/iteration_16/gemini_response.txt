Of course. As a senior software developer, I understand the importance of building software that is not only functional but also robust, maintainable, and efficient. Adhering to standards like ISO/IEC 25010 is key to achieving this.

Here is a high-quality Python implementation of a console-based todo list application.

### Design Philosophy (Adherence to ISO/IEC 25010)

Before presenting the code, let's briefly discuss how the design aligns with the principles of ISO/IEC 25010:

*   **Functional Suitability:** The `TaskManager` class provides a complete and correct implementation of all required features (`add`, `remove`, `search`, etc.).
*   **Performance Efficiency:** The choice of a dictionary for the primary data store (`self._tasks`) ensures O(1) average time complexity for key operations like adding, removing, and retrieving tasks by ID. This is crucial for time-behavior.
*   **Maintainability & Modularity:** The logic is encapsulated within the `TaskManager` class. This separation of concerns makes the code highly modular. For instance, the in-memory storage could be replaced with a database engine without altering the class's public interface, demonstrating high **modifiability**.
*   **Reliability & Fault Tolerance:** The code uses custom, specific exceptions (`TaskNotFoundError`, `InvalidTaskDataError`) to handle predictable errors gracefully. This makes the system more fault-tolerant, as the calling code can distinguish between different error types.
*   **Security:** By implementing strict input validation (e.g., checking for non-empty strings, valid IDs), we protect the system's integrity from invalid data, which is a fundamental aspect of application security.
*   **Testability:** The `TaskManager` class has no external dependencies (like file I/O or network calls), making it trivial to unit test. Each method can be tested in isolation.
*   **Readability (Part of Maintainability):** The code is thoroughly documented with type hints and PEP 257 compliant docstrings. Variable names are descriptive, and the logic is straightforward, ensuring it is easy for other developers to understand and maintain.

### Example Usage (Console UI)

To demonstrate how the `TaskManager` class can be used, here is a simple command-line interface. This code would typically reside in a separate file (e.g., `main.py`) and import the `TaskManager`. For this example, it's included below.

```python
# --- Example Command-Line Interface ---

def print_task(task: Dict[str, Any]):
    """Helper function to print a single task in a user-friendly format."""
    status = "✓" if task["is_finished"] else "✗"
    print(f"[{status}] ID: {task['id']} | {task['name']} - {task['description']}")

def run_cli():
    """Runs the command-line interface for the TaskManager."""
    manager = TaskManager()
    print("--- Console Todo List App ---")

    # Pre-populate with some data for demonstration
    try:
        manager.add("Buy groceries", "Milk, Bread, Cheese")
        manager.add("Finish report", "Complete the Q3 financial report.")
        manager.add("Call dentist", "Schedule a check-up for next week.")
    except InvalidTaskDataError as e:
        print(f"Initialization Error: {e}")

    while True:
        print("\nCommands: add, remove, search, finish, all, clear, exit")
        command = input("Enter command: ").strip().lower()

        try:
            if command == "add":
                name = input("Enter task name: ")
                desc = input("Enter task description: ")
                task_id = manager.add(name, desc)

                    print("--- Search Results ---")
                    for task in results:

                    print("-----------------")

            elif command == "clear":
                confirm = input("Are you sure you want to delete all tasks? (y/n): ")
                if confirm.lower() == 'y':
                    manager.clear_all()
                    print("Success: All tasks have been cleared.")
                else:
                    print("Operation cancelled.")

            elif command == "exit":
                print("Exiting application. Goodbye!")
                break

            else:
                print("Unknown command. Please try again.")

        except (TaskNotFoundError, InvalidTaskDataError) as e:
