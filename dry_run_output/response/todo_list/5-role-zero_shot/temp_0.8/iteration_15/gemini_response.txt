Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a Python solution for the console-based todo list application that adheres to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard and follows best practices for creating high-quality, maintainable code.

Here is the complete implementation, including the `TaskManager` class, a demonstration of its usage in a command-line interface, and detailed documentation.

### Rationale for Design Choices (ISO/IEC 25010)

*   **Functional Suitability & Correctness**: The code correctly implements all specified functionalities (`add`, `remove`, `search`, etc.), ensuring it behaves as expected.
*   **Performance Efficiency**: The core data structure is a Python dictionary (`self._tasks`). This provides average O(1) time complexity for additions, removals, and lookups by ID, which is highly efficient. The `search` operation is O(n), which is unavoidable as it requires scanning all task content.
*   **Maintainability & Modularity**: The application logic is encapsulated entirely within the `TaskManager` class. The user interface (the `main` function) is separate. This separation of concerns means the storage mechanism could be swapped (e.g., to a database or file) by only modifying the `TaskManager` class, without affecting the UI code.
*   **Reliability & Safety**:
    *   **Error Handling**: The class raises specific, built-in exceptions (`ValueError`, `TypeError`, `KeyError`) for invalid operations. The UI code in `main` gracefully catches these exceptions and provides clear, user-friendly error messages.
    *   **Input Validation**: Each public method validates its inputs (e.g., checking for empty strings, positive IDs), preventing corrupt data from entering the system.
*   **Usability**: The console interface is straightforward, and feedback (success or error messages) is provided for every user action.
*   **Testability**: The `TaskManager` class is a standalone unit with no dependencies on global state or I/O, making it easy to instantiate and test its methods in an automated unit testing framework.
*   **Readability & Documentation**: The code is thoroughly documented with PEP 257 compliant docstrings, uses type hints for clarity, and employs descriptive variable names, making it easy for other developers to understand and maintain.
