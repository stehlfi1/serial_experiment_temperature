Of course. As a senior software developer, I will create a high-quality, maintainable, and well-documented console-based todo list application in Python.

This solution is designed with the principles of the **ISO/IEC 25010** standard in mind:

*   **Functional Suitability:** The code correctly implements all required functionalities (`add`, `remove`, `search`, etc.).
*   **Performance Efficiency:** It uses a dictionary for task storage, providing efficient O(1) average time complexity for ID-based operations like adding, removing, and updating.
*   **Maintainability & Modularity:** The logic is encapsulated within a `TaskManager` class, and a `Task` `dataclass` is used for clear data representation. The core logic is completely separate from the user interface.
*   **Reliability & Safety:** The application includes robust input validation and raises specific, standard exceptions (`ValueError`, `TypeError`), which are handled gracefully by the user interface layer.
*   **Testability:** The `TaskManager` class is self-contained and can be easily instantiated and tested independently of the console UI.
*   **Readability:** The code uses clear variable names, comprehensive docstrings (Google Style), and type hints, making it easy to understand and use.

Here is the complete implementation:
