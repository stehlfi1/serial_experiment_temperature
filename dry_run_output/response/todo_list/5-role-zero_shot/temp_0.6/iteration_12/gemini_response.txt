Of course. As a senior software developer, I understand the importance of creating code that is not only functional but also robust, maintainable, and efficient, adhering to standards like ISO/IEC 25010.

Here is a high-quality Python implementation of the console-based todo list application, designed with these principles in mind.

### Analysis against ISO/IEC 25010 Characteristics

Before presenting the code, here's a brief analysis of how the design maps to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard:

*   **Functional Suitability:** The `TaskManager` class correctly implements all required functionalities (`add`, `remove`, `search`, etc.) as specified.
*   **Performance Efficiency:** The choice of a dictionary (`self._tasks`) for in-memory storage ensures O(1) average time complexity for key operations like adding, removing, and retrieving tasks by ID. This is optimal for the given requirements.
*   **Compatibility:** The code uses standard Python libraries and can coexist with other components in a larger application without issue.
*   **Usability:** For the developer using this class, the API is clear, well-documented, and provides explicit error feedback through standard exceptions.
*   **Reliability:** The code is reliable due to its robust input validation (maturity), clear error handling (fault tolerance), and predictable state management that allows for easy recovery (recoverability).
*   **Security:** While this is a simple console app, basic security principles are applied by validating inputs to prevent unexpected behavior or state corruption.
*   **Maintainability:**
    *   **Modularity:** The logic is encapsulated within the `TaskManager` class, separating it from the user interface. An internal `_Task` dataclass is used to structure task data cleanly.
    *   **Reusability:** The `TaskManager` class can be easily imported and reused in other contexts (e.g., a web API, a GUI application).
    *   **Analysability & Testability:** The class has no external dependencies (like files or a database), making it simple to analyze and unit test.
    *   **Modifiability:** The clear separation of concerns makes it easy to modify or extend functionality without breaking existing parts.
*   **Portability:** The code uses only Python's standard library, making it highly portable across any platform with a Python interpreter.
