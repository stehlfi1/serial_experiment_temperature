Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a high-quality Python implementation for a console-based todo list application. The solution will be structured using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and will adhere to the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard for software quality.

### Adherence to ISO/IEC 25010

The provided code is designed with the following ISO/IEC 25010 characteristics in mind:

*   **Functional Suitability:** The `TaskManager` class correctly implements all required functionalities (`add`, `remove`, `search`, `finish`, `get_all`, `clear_all`).
*   **Performance Efficiency:** By using a dictionary (`self._tasks`) as the primary in-memory data store, operations like adding, removing, and finishing tasks (which are ID-based) are performed in average O(1) time complexity.
*   **Compatibility:** The code uses standard Python libraries (`dataclasses`, `typing`) and requires no external dependencies, ensuring it runs on any standard Python 3.7+ environment.
*   **Usability:** A clear, interactive command-line interface is provided in the example usage block to demonstrate and utilize the `TaskManager`'s functionality.
*   **Reliability:**
    *   **Maturity:** The code includes robust error handling and input validation to prevent crashes from invalid user input (e.g., non-existent IDs, empty task names).
    *   **Fault Tolerance:** The `try...except` blocks in the main execution part ensure that errors are caught gracefully and user-friendly messages are displayed, allowing the application to continue running.
*   **Security:** While this is a simple console app, the principle of input validation (`_validate_inputs`) helps prevent unexpected behavior, a foundational aspect of secure coding.
*   **Maintainability:**
    *   **Modularity:** The logic is encapsulated within the `TaskManager` class, and the data structure for a task is defined separately in the `Task` dataclass. The user interface logic is separate from the core business logic.
    *   **Reusability:** The `TaskManager` class can be easily imported and used in other contexts, such as a web application or a different type of UI.
    *   **Analyzability & Testability:** The class has no external dependencies (like files or databases), making it simple to instantiate and test its methods in isolation.
    *   **Modifiability:** The clear separation of concerns makes it easy to modify one part of the system (e.g., changing the storage mechanism) without impacting others.
*   **Portability:** The code is platform-independent and relies only on the Python standard library.
