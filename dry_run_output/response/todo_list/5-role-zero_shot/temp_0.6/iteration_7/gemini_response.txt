Of course. Here is a high-quality Python implementation of the console-based todo list application, designed with the principles of ISO/IEC 25010 in mind.

This solution emphasizes **maintainability**, **reliability**, and **performance efficiency** through clear object-oriented design, robust error handling, and appropriate data structure choices.

A module for managing a collection of tasks in memory.

This module provides the TaskManager class, which implements a full
Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) interface for a todo list. It is
designed for high performance and reliability, adhering to best practices
for clean, maintainable, and testable code.

    ISO/IEC 25010 Compliance:
    - Functional Suitability: Implements all required functionalities (add, remove, etc.).
    - Performance Efficiency: Uses a dictionary for O(1) average time complexity
      for lookups, insertions, and deletions by ID.
    - Reliability: Implements robust error handling and input validation to
      ensure maturity and fault tolerance.
    - Maintainability: Code is modular (Task class, TaskManager class),
      well-documented, and uses clear, consistent naming conventions.
    - Testability: The class is self-contained and can be easily instantiated
      and tested in isolation.
