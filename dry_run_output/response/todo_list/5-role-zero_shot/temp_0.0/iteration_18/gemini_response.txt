Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a high-quality Python implementation for a console-based todo list application. The solution will adhere to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard by focusing on maintainability, performance, reliability, and functional suitability.

The code is structured using Object-Oriented Principles, with a clear separation between the core logic (`TaskManager`) and the user interface (the console runner). This design ensures the code is modular, testable, and reusable.

Here is the complete, well-documented solution:

```python
"""
A high-quality, console-based Todo List application in Python.

This module provides a TaskManager class that encapsulates all the logic for
managing tasks, adhering to best practices for software design and the
ISO/IEC 25010 standard for software quality.

ISO/IEC 25010 Characteristics Addressed:
- Functional Suitability: Implements all required features correctly.
- Performance Efficiency: Uses efficient data structures (dictionaries) for
  time-critical operations like lookups, insertions, and deletions (O(1)).
- Maintainability:
    - Modularity: The TaskManager class is a self-contained, reusable component.
    - Readability: Code is documented with docstrings, type hints, and clear
      variable names.
    - Testability: The core logic is decoupled from the UI, making it easy to
      unit test.
- Reliability:
    - Maturity: The logic is robust and handles expected workflows.
    - Fault Tolerance: Gracefully handles errors and invalid user inputs
      through custom exceptions and validation, preventing crashes.
