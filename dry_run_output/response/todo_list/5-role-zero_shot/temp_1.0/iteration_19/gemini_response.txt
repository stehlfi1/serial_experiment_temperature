Of course. As a senior software developer, I will create a high-quality, maintainable, and well-documented console-based todo list application in Python.

The solution adheres to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard by focusing on:
*   **Functional Suitability:** All required functions are implemented correctly.
*   **Performance Efficiency:** Uses a dictionary for O(1) average time complexity on lookups, insertions, and deletions.
*   **Maintainability:** The code is modular (logic separated from UI), well-documented, readable, and easily testable.
*   **Reliability:** Robust error handling and input validation prevent crashes and unexpected behavior.
*   **Usability:** A clear, interactive command-line interface makes the application easy to operate.
*   **Portability:** Uses only standard Python libraries, ensuring it runs on any system with Python 3.

Here is the complete implementation:
