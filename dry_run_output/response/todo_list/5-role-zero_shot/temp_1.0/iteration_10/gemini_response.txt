Of course. As a senior software developer, I'll construct a solution that not only meets your functional requirements but also embodies the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard, focusing on maintainability, reliability, and performance efficiency.

### Design Rationale and Adherence to ISO/IEC 25010

Before presenting the code, here is a brief explanation of how the design choices align with the quality standard:

1.  **Functional Suitability & Correctness:** The `TaskManager` class strictly implements the requested interface (`add`, `remove`, `search`, etc.), ensuring it performs its specified tasks correctly. The `if __name__ == "__main__"` block provides a demonstration and a basic smoke test to verify this.

2.  **Performance Efficiency:** The core data structure is a Python dictionary (`self._tasks`). This choice is deliberate. It provides average O(1) time complexity for key-based operations: `add` (insertion), `remove` (deletion), and `finish` (lookup and update). This is significantly more efficient than using a list, which would require O(n) for searches and removals.

3.  **Reliability & Safety:**
    *   **Error Handling:** The code uses specific, built-in exception types (`ValueError`, `TypeError`) to signal issues, allowing the calling code to handle failures gracefully.
    *   **Input Validation:** Each public method rigorously validates its inputs (e.g., checking for empty strings, correct types, and the existence of a `task_id`). This prevents the system from entering an invalid state, a key aspect of reliability.
    *   **Encapsulation:** The internal data structures (`_tasks`, `_next_id`) are prefixed with an underscore, signaling they are not part of the public API and should not be modified directly. Methods like `get_all` and `search` return *copies* of the task data, preventing external code from accidentally modifying the internal state of the `TaskManager`.

4.  **Maintainability & Testability:**
    *   **Modularity:** The `TaskManager` is a self-contained class with a clear responsibility. A private helper method (`_validate_task_id`) is used to avoid code duplication, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
    *   **Readability & Documentation:** The code adheres to PEP 8 standards. It includes comprehensive docstrings for the class and all methods, explaining their purpose, parameters, return values, and potential exceptions. Type hints are used throughout for clarity and to support static analysis.
    *   **Testability:** The class has no external dependencies (like files or a database), making it trivial to instantiate and test in a unit testing framework. Its behavior is deterministic and based solely on its inputs.

Here is the high-quality Python code for the console-based todo list application.
