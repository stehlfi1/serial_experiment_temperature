Of course. As a senior software developer, I will create a high-quality Python implementation for a console-based To-Do list application. The design will prioritize the principles outlined in the ISO/IEC 25010 standard, focusing on maintainability, reliability, performance efficiency, and security through robust validation.

### Design Rationale

1.  **Modularity & Testability:**
    *   A `Task` dataclass is defined to represent the task data structure. This provides type safety, immutability for certain fields (if needed), and a clean, self-documenting way to handle task objects.
    *   The `TaskManager` class encapsulates all business logic, separating the application's core functionality from any potential user interface. This makes the core logic highly reusable and easy to unit test independently.

2.  **Performance Efficiency:**
    *   The primary data store is a Python dictionary (`self._tasks`). This structure is chosen for its excellent performance characteristics for the required operations:
        *   **Lookup by ID:** `O(1)` average time complexity.
        *   **Insertion (Add):** `O(1)` average time complexity.
        *   **Deletion (Remove):** `O(1)` average time complexity.
    *   This is significantly more efficient than using a list, which would require `O(n)` for lookups and deletions by ID.

3.  **Reliability & Safety (Error Handling):**
    *   Input validation is performed at the beginning of each method to "fail fast." This prevents invalid data from entering the system.
    *   Specific, built-in exception types like `ValueError` (for bad data) and `KeyError` (for non-existent IDs) are used. This allows the calling code to handle different error conditions gracefully and precisely.
    *   A unique, auto-incrementing ID is managed internally, ensuring no duplicate IDs can be created.

4.  **Readability & Maintainability:**
    *   The code is fully type-hinted, which improves clarity and allows for static analysis.
    *   Comprehensive docstrings are provided for the classes and methods, explaining their purpose, parameters, return values, and potential exceptions, adhering to the Google Python Style Guide.
    *   Variable and method names are descriptive and follow Python's PEP 8 conventions.

Here is the implementation:
