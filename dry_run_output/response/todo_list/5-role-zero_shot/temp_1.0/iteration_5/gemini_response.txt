Of course. As a senior software developer, I will construct a high-quality, maintainable, and well-documented Python application for a console-based to-do list.

The design prioritizes the principles of the **ISO/IEC 25010** standard by focusing on:
*   **Maintainability**: Achieved through high modularity (separating core logic from the user interface), clear documentation (docstrings, type hints), and readability.
*   **Reliability**: Ensured by robust error handling and comprehensive input validation.
*   **Performance Efficiency**: Implemented using an optimal data structure (a dictionary) for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions.
*   **Functional Suitability**: All specified requirements are correctly and completely implemented.
*   **Testability**: The core `TaskManager` class is decoupled from the UI, making it easy to unit test independently.
*   **Safety**: Invalid inputs are caught and handled gracefully, preventing the application from entering an unstable state.

Here is the complete solution.

"""
A console-based To-Do list application demonstrating best practices.

This module provides a TaskManager class that handles the core logic for managing
a list of tasks in memory. It is designed with the ISO/IEC 25010 standard
in mind, emphasizing maintainability, reliability, and performance efficiency.

The user interface is handled separately in the main execution block, ensuring
a clean separation of concerns.
