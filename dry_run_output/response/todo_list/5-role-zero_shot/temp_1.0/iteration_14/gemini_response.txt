Of course. As a senior software developer committed to the principles of ISO/IEC 25010, I will provide a high-quality, robust, and maintainable implementation of the console-based todo list application.

The solution will be structured into two main parts:
1.  **`TaskManager` Class**: The core logic, completely decoupled from the user interface. This ensures **modularity**, **testability**, and **reusability**.
2.  **`main()` function**: The console user interface, which acts as a client to the `TaskManager` class. This handles all user I/O.

This design adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle and promotes clean architecture.

Here is the complete, high-quality Python code:

```python
"""
A console-based Todo List application demonstrating best practices in Python.

This module provides a TaskManager class that encapsulates all business logic
for managing tasks. The design adheres to principles outlined in ISO/IEC 25010,
focusing on:
- Functional Suitability: Correctly implements all required features.
- Performance Efficiency: Uses efficient data structures (dictionaries) for
  O(1) average time complexity for ID-based lookups, insertions, and deletions.
- Compatibility/Portability: Uses only Python's standard library.
- Usability: Provides a clear, interactive console interface.
- Reliability: Includes robust error handling and input validation.
- Security: Implements basic protection against invalid input.
- Maintainability: Features a modular, decoupled design with clear,
  documented code, making it easy to understand, modify, and test.
- Reusability: The TaskManager class can be easily reused in other contexts
  (e.g., a web API, a GUI application).
