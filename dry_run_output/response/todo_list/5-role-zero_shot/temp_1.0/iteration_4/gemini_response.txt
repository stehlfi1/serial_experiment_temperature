Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a Python solution for the console-based todo list application. The design prioritizes the quality characteristics defined in the ISO/IEC 25010 standard, such as maintainability, performance efficiency, reliability, and security (in the context of data integrity).

The following implementation uses a dedicated `dataclass` for task representation to ensure data consistency and a `TaskManager` class that encapsulates all business logic. This separation of concerns enhances modularity and testability. The primary data structure is a dictionary, which provides O(1) average-case time complexity for ID-based operations like lookups, updates, and deletions, fulfilling the performance requirement.

Here is the high-quality Python code:

### Explanation of How ISO/IEC 25010 Requirements Are Met

*   **Functional Suitability**: The code correctly implements all required functions (`add`, `remove`, `search`, `finish`, `get_all`, `clear_all`) as per the specification.
*   **Performance Efficiency**: The use of a dictionary (`self._tasks`) for storing `Task` objects allows for constant time O(1) lookups, insertions, and deletions based on the task ID. `get_all` is O(N log N) due to sorting for consistent output, and `search` is O(N) as it must iterate through all tasks. This is an efficient approach for the given requirements.
*   **Reliability & Security (Safety)**:
    *   **Error Handling**: The code gracefully handles invalid operations by raising specific, built-in Python exceptions (`ValueError`, `TypeError`). This allows the calling code (e.g., a UI layer) to handle failures robustly.
    *   **Input Validation**: Inputs are validated at the beginning of each public method to prevent corrupted data. For example, it checks for empty strings in `add` and `search`, and correct types for all inputs. This protects the system's internal state.
*   **Maintainability**:
    *   **Modularity**: The logic is separated into a `Task` data class and a `TaskManager` class. The `Task` class is responsible for its own data, and the `TaskManager` handles the collection and business logic. This separation makes the code easier to understand, modify, and extend.
    *   **Testability**: The `TaskManager` class is self-contained and does not depend on global state or external I/O (like `input()` or `print()`). It can be easily instantiated and tested in an automated testing framework like `pytest`.
    *   **Readability and Documentation**: The code is thoroughly documented with docstrings, type hints (`typing` module), and descriptive variable names. This makes it easy for other developers to understand its purpose, arguments, and return values. The use of a `@dataclass` also simplifies the representation of the `Task` object.
*   **Usability**: While the code itself is a backend library, it provides a clean and predictable API. The `main()` function demonstrates how this API can be consumed by a user-facing component, proving its usability in a larger application.
