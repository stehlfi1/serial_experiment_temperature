Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a high-quality Python implementation for the console-based todo list application. The solution will adhere to the specified requirements, focusing on the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard, such as maintainability, performance efficiency, reliability, and usability from a developer's perspective.

The code is structured using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), with a clear separation of concerns. A `Task` data class is used to represent the data model, and the `TaskManager` class encapsulates all business logic. This design enhances modularity and testability.

Here is the complete, documented, and high-quality Python code.

```python
"""
A high-quality, maintainable implementation of a console-based Todo List application.

This module provides a TaskManager class that adheres to the principles of
ISO/IEC 25010, focusing on:
- Functional Suitability: Implements all required features (add, remove, etc.).
- Performance Efficiency: Uses efficient data structures (dictionaries) for
  key operations.
- Reliability: Includes robust error handling and input validation.
- Maintainability: Features a modular, object-oriented design with clear,
  documented, and testable code.
- Usability (for developers): Provides a clean and predictable API.
