Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a high-quality Python implementation for a console-based todo list application. The solution will be structured using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and will strictly adhere to the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard for software quality.

### Adherence to ISO/IEC 25010

Here is a brief breakdown of how this implementation addresses the key characteristics of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard:

*   **Functional Suitability:** The code correctly implements all required functionalities (`add`, `remove`, `search`, `finish`, `get_all`, `clear_all`).
*   **Performance Efficiency:** It uses a dictionary for the primary data store, providing average O(1) time complexity for additions, removals, and lookups by ID. Search operations are O(n), which is optimal for the given requirements.
*   **Maintainability:**
    *   **Modularity:** The `TaskManager` class encapsulates all business logic, completely separating it from the user interface (the console interaction loop).
    *   **Testability:** Because the logic is encapsulated, the `TaskManager` class can be instantiated and tested independently of any UI.
    *   **Readability:** The code is documented with docstrings, uses clear variable names, and includes type hints for clarity.
*   **Reliability:**
    *   **Maturity:** The logic is robust and handles core operations cleanly.
    *   **Fault Tolerance:** The code uses specific, built-in exceptions (`ValueError`, `TypeError`, `KeyError`) for invalid operations. The UI part gracefully catches these exceptions and informs the user without crashing.
*   **Security (Safety):** Input is validated at the boundaries of the `TaskManager` methods to prevent corrupted data states (e.g., tasks with no name, negative IDs).

### Python Implementation

Here is the complete, high-quality Python code for the todo list application.

```python

A high-quality, console-based Todo List application in Python.

This module provides a TaskManager class that handles all the logic for a
todo list, including adding, removing, and searching for tasks. The implementation

maintainability, performance, and reliability.
