Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a high-quality Python implementation for the console-based todo list application.

The solution adheres to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard by focusing on:
*   **Functional Suitability:** The code correctly implements all required functionalities (`add`, `remove`, etc.).
*   **Performance Efficiency:** It uses a dictionary for data storage, ensuring optimal `O(1)` average time complexity for additions, deletions, and lookups by ID.
*   **Reliability & Safety:** Robust input validation and graceful error handling are implemented using standard Python exceptions.
*   **Maintainability & Testability:** The code is modular, encapsulated within a single class, and free of external dependencies, making it easy to understand, modify, and test.
*   **Usability (from a developer's perspective):** A clear, type-hinted interface and comprehensive documentation make the class easy to integrate and use.

Here is the complete implementation:
