Of course. Here is a high-quality Python implementation of a console-based to-do list application, designed according to your specifications and adhering to the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard.

### Explanation of ISO/IEC 25010 Adherence

This implementation addresses the key characteristics of the ISO/IEC 25010 quality model:

*   **Functional Suitability:** The code provides all requested functions (`add`, `remove`, etc.) and behaves as expected, ensuring correctness and completeness.
*   **Performance Efficiency:** By using a dictionary (`self._tasks`) with the task ID as the key, core operations like adding, removing, finishing, and retrieving a task by its ID are performed in average O(1) time complexity. The search operation is O(n), which is appropriate for this use case.
*   **Maintainability:**
    *   **Modularity:** The logic is encapsulated within the `TaskManager` class. A `Task` `dataclass` is used to cleanly structure task data, separating the data model from the management logic.
    *   **Reusability:** The `TaskManager` class is self-contained and can be easily imported and used in other contexts (e.g., a web API, a GUI application).
    *   **Testability:** The class has no external dependencies (like files or databases), making it straightforward to unit test.
*   **Reliability:**
    *   **Fault Tolerance:** Invalid inputs (e.g., empty strings, non-existent IDs) are handled gracefully through explicit validation and conditional checks, preventing crashes and returning meaningful feedback (errors or boolean status).
*   **Security:**
    *   **Input Validation:** The code includes robust validation at the entry point of each public method to protect the system's internal state from invalid data, as required by the "Safety" characteristic.
*   **Usability (for the developer):**
    *   **Readability and Documentation:** The code is written with clear variable names, comprehensive docstrings (following PEP 257), and type hints, making the API easy to understand and use correctly.
