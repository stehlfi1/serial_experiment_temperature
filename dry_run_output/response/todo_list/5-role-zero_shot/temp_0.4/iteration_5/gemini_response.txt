Of course. As a senior software developer, I understand the importance of creating code that is not only functional but also robust, maintainable, and efficient, adhering to the principles outlined in ISO/IEC 25010.

Here is a high-quality Python implementation of the console-based todo list application.

### Rationale for Design Choices (ISO/IEC 25010 Alignment)

*   **Functional Suitability:** The `TaskManager` class directly implements all required functionalities (`add`, `remove`, etc.), ensuring the program is complete and correct according to the specification.
*   **Performance Efficiency:**
    *   The core data structure is a dictionary (`self._tasks`). This allows for O(1) average time complexity for key operations like adding, removing, finishing, and retrieving a task by its ID. This is significantly more efficient than using a list, which would require O(n) for lookups and removals.
    *   The task ID counter (`self._next_id`) provides a simple and efficient O(1) mechanism for generating unique IDs.
*   **Reliability & Safety:**
    *   **Maturity & Fault Tolerance:** Robust validation is implemented at the beginning of each method to handle invalid inputs (e.g., wrong types, empty strings). This prevents the application from entering an unstable state.
    *   **Error Handling:** The code uses specific, built-in exceptions (`ValueError`, `TypeError`) to signal different kinds of errors. This allows the calling code (the user interface) to catch and handle these errors gracefully, providing clear feedback to the user instead of crashing.
*   **Maintainability & Portability:**
    *   **Modularity:** The application logic is encapsulated entirely within the `TaskManager` class. The user interface logic is separate in the `main()` function. This separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand, modify, and test. You could easily swap the console UI for a web or GUI front-end without changing the `TaskManager` class.
    *   **Testability:** Because the `TaskManager` class has no external dependencies (like files or databases) and does not rely on global state, it can be easily instantiated and tested in an automated unit testing framework.
    *   **Readability & Analyzability:** The code uses clear, descriptive variable names (`task_term`, `task_id`), comprehensive docstrings (following PEP 257), and type hints (PEP 484). This makes the code self-documenting and easier for other developers to understand and maintain.
