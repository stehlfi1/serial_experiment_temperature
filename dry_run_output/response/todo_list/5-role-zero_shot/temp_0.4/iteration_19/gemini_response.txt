Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a high-quality, maintainable, and well-documented Python implementation for a console-based todo list application.

The design adheres to the principles of the **ISO/IEC 25010** standard, focusing on:

*   **Maintainability & Modularity:** The core logic is encapsulated within the `TaskManager` class, completely separate from the user interface. This makes the logic reusable, independently testable, and easy to modify (e.g., to switch from in-memory storage to a database).
*   **Reliability & Safety:** The code uses custom, specific exceptions for predictable error handling. All public methods validate their inputs to protect against invalid data, ensuring fault tolerance and system integrity.
*   **Performance Efficiency:** A dictionary is used for the primary task storage (`self._tasks`), providing O(1) average time complexity for adding, removing, and retrieving tasks by their ID.
*   **Functional Suitability:** The implementation correctly and completely provides all the required functionalities (`add`, `remove`, `search`, etc.).
*   **Readability & Testability:** The code is thoroughly documented with docstrings, uses clear variable names, and includes type hints. The separation of concerns makes unit testing the `TaskManager` straightforward.

Here is the complete, high-quality Python code.

"""
A high-quality, console-based Todo List application.

This module provides a TaskManager class that handles the business logic for a
todo list, and a simple command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.

The design adheres to ISO/IEC 25010 principles, emphasizing maintainability,
reliability, and efficiency.
