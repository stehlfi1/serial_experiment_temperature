Of course. As a senior software developer, I understand the importance of creating code that is not only functional but also robust, maintainable, and adheres to high-quality standards like ISO/IEC 25010.

Here is a high-quality Python implementation of a console-based calculator. The design focuses on modularity, safety, and readability by separating the logic into three distinct phases: tokenization, parsing (using the Shunting-yard algorithm), and evaluation.

***

### Rationale for Design Choices (ISO/IEC 25010)

*   **Functional Suitability (Correctness):** The implementation uses the Shunting-yard algorithm to parse expressions, which correctly handles operator precedence and parentheses. This is a standard, proven algorithm for this task, ensuring mathematical correctness.
*   **Performance Efficiency:** The tokenization, parsing, and evaluation steps all have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the expression. This is highly efficient as each character and token is processed a constant number of times.
*   **Maintainability (Modularity & Reusability):** The problem is broken down into logical, encapsulated components:
    1.  `_tokenize`: Converts the raw string into a list of tokens.
    2.  `_shunting_yard`: Converts the infix token stream to postfix (RPN).
    3.  `_evaluate_rpn`: Evaluates the simple RPN expression.
    This separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand, debug, and extend (e.g., adding new functions or operators).
*   **Reliability (Robustness & Fault Tolerance):** The code is designed to be safe against invalid input. It explicitly checks for:
    *   Invalid characters.
    *   Unbalanced parentheses.
    *   Division by zero.
    *   Malformed expressions (e.g., `5 * + 3`).
    It uses specific, built-in Python exceptions (`ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError`) to signal these issues clearly.
*   **Usability (Operability):** The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block provides a simple, clear command-line interface for users to interact with the calculator. Error messages are caught and displayed in a user-friendly manner.
*   **Security:** By implementing a custom parser and avoiding `eval()`, the code is protected against code injection attacks, a critical security vulnerability.
*   **Portability & Compatibility:** The code uses only standard Python libraries and features, ensuring it runs on any system with a compatible Python interpreter.
*   **Maintainability (Testability & Analyzability):** Each private method (`_tokenize`, `_shunting_yard`, `_evaluate_rpn`) can be tested in isolation, which is a cornerstone of unit testing. The clear separation of logic makes it easy to analyze the cause of any potential bugs.

### Calculator Implementation

```python
import re
from typing import List, Union

class Calculator:
    """
    A high-quality, safe, and maintainable arithmetic calculator.

    This class evaluates mathematical expressions from a string, supporting addition,
    subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses. It adheres to standard
    operator precedence.

    The evaluation is performed without using Python's `eval()` function to ensure
    safety against code injection. The process involves three main steps:
    1. Tokenization: The input string is broken into numbers and operators.
    2. Shunting-yard Algorithm: The infix expression (standard notation) is
       converted to a postfix expression (Reverse Polish Notation - RPN).
    3. RPN Evaluation: The postfix expression is evaluated using a stack.

    This approach ensures correctness, efficiency, and security.
