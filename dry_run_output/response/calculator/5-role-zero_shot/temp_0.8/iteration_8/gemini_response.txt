Of course. As a senior software developer, I will create a high-quality Python implementation for a console-based calculator. The solution will be structured using Object-Oriented principles and will adhere to the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard for software quality.

### Design Philosophy (Mapping to ISO/IEC 25010)

Before presenting the code, here is a brief explanation of how the design choices map to the requested quality standard:

*   **Functional Suitability (Correctness, Completeness):** The core logic is built around a standard and proven computer science algorithm: the **Shunting-yard algorithm** for converting infix notation to postfix (RPN), followed by an RPN evaluation. This ensures correctness for operator precedence, parentheses, and the required operations.
*   **Performance Efficiency (Time Behaviour):** The tokenizer, Shunting-yard algorithm, and RPN evaluator all operate in linear time, O(n), where 'n' is the length of the expression string. This is highly efficient and avoids performance degradation with longer expressions.
*   **Maintainability (Modularity, Analysability, Testability):**
    *   **Modularity:** The problem is broken down into three logical, independent components: a tokenizer (`_tokenize`), an infix-to-postfix converter (`_shunting_yard`), and a postfix evaluator (`_evaluate_rpn`).
    *   **Analysability:** Each component has a single, clear responsibility. This makes it easy to diagnose issues—a parsing error is in the tokenizer, a precedence error is in the shunting-yard, and a calculation error is in the evaluator.
    *   **Testability:** Each of these components can be unit-tested in isolation, verifying its behavior before integrating it into the final `calculate` method.
*   **Reliability (Maturity, Fault Tolerance):**
    *   **Maturity:** The design uses standard algorithms and data structures (lists as stacks/queues), which are mature and well-understood.
    *   **Fault Tolerance:** The code explicitly validates input at every stage. It raises specific, built-in Python errors like `ValueError` for malformed expressions (e.g., invalid characters, unbalanced parentheses) and `ZeroDivisionError` for illegal mathematical operations.
*   **Security (Safety):** The explicit prohibition of `eval()` is a critical security measure. `eval()` can execute arbitrary code, creating a major vulnerability. By parsing the expression manually, we completely eliminate this risk.
*   **Usability & Portability:** The code uses only standard Python libraries, ensuring it can run on any system with a Python interpreter. Error messages are clear and help the user understand what went wrong.

### Calculator Implementation

Here is the complete, high-quality Python code for the calculator.

```python

    A robust, safe, and efficient calculator that evaluates arithmetic expressions
    from a string. It adheres to ISO/IEC 25010 quality standards by being
    modular, testable, and secure (it does not use eval()).

    The evaluation process is performed in three stages:
    1.  Tokenization: The input string is broken down into a list of numbers
        and operators.
    2.  Shunting-yard Algorithm: The infix token list is converted to a
        postfix (Reverse Polish Notation) queue. This correctly handles
        operator precedence and parentheses.
    3.  RPN Evaluation: The postfix queue is evaluated to produce the final result.
