Of course. As a senior software developer, I understand the importance of creating code that is not only functional but also robust, maintainable, and well-documented. Here is a high-quality implementation of a console-based calculator that adheres to the specified requirements and the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard.

### Design Rationale (Adherence to ISO/IEC 25010)

Before presenting the code, here's a brief explanation of how the design meets the key characteristics of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard:

*   **Functional Suitability:** The calculator correctly implements all required arithmetic operations, including parentheses and operator precedence, fulfilling the core functional requirements.
*   **Performance Efficiency:** The implementation uses a two-pass approach (Shunting-yard for parsing, then RPN evaluation), both of which operate in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of the expression. This is highly efficient and avoids the performance and security overhead of methods like `eval()`.
*   **Maintainability & Modularity:** The logic is broken down into distinct, private methods: `_tokenize`, `_to_rpn` (implementing the Shunting-yard algorithm), and `_evaluate_rpn`. This separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand, debug, and extend (e.g., adding new operators would only require minor changes in a few focused locations).
*   **Reliability & Security (Safety):** The code is built to be resilient.
    *   **Error Handling:** It gracefully handles invalid inputs, such as unknown characters, unbalanced parentheses, malformed expressions, and division by zero, by raising specific, built-in Python exceptions (`ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError`).
    *   **Security:** By explicitly forbidding and avoiding `eval()`, we eliminate the risk of arbitrary code execution, a major security vulnerability.
*   **Usability (from a developer's perspective/Testability):** The code is encapsulated within a `Calculator` class with a single public method `calculate()`. This clean interface makes it trivial to instantiate and use in other parts of an application or in a testing suite.
*   **Readability and Documentation:** The code is thoroughly documented with docstrings for the class and all methods, explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values. Type hints are used throughout to improve clarity and enable static analysis. Variable names are descriptive and follow Python conventions (e.g., `_` prefix for internal methods).

### Python Calculator Implementation

```python
import operator
from typing import List, Union

class Calculator:
    """
    A high-quality, safe, and maintainable arithmetic calculator.

    This class evaluates mathematical expressions from a string, supporting addition,
    subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses. It adheres to standard
    operator precedence.

    The implementation uses the Shunting-yard algorithm to convert the infix
    expression to Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), which is then evaluated.
    This approach is efficient and avoids the use of `eval()`, ensuring safety.

    ISO/IEC 25010 Compliance:
    - Functional Suitability: Correctly evaluates expressions.
    - Performance Efficiency: O(n) time complexity.
    - Modularity: Logic is separated into tokenization, parsing, and evaluation.
    - Reliability: Robust error handling for invalid input and operations.
    - Security: No `eval()` is used, preventing code injection vulnerabilities.
    - Maintainability: Clean, documented, and easily extensible.
