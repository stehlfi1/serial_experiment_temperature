Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a solution that not only meets the functional requirements but also embodies the principles of high-quality software design as outlined in the ISO/IEC 25010 standard.

### Design Rationale and ISO/IEC 25010 Compliance

The following solution is designed with the ISO/IEC 25010 quality characteristics in mind:

1.  **Functional Suitability:** The calculator correctly implements all required arithmetic operations, including operator precedence and parentheses, for both integer and floating-point numbers.
2.  **Performance Efficiency:** The implementation uses the **Shunting-yard algorithm** to parse the expression. This algorithm processes the input in a single pass (O(n) time complexity), which is highly efficient. The subsequent evaluation of the Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is also O(n).
3.  **Maintainability & Modularity:** The code is structured into a `Calculator` class with private helper methods, each responsible for a distinct logical step: tokenization, parsing (Shunting-yard), and evaluation. This separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand, modify, and debug. For instance, adding a new operator would only require minor changes in specific, localized methods.
4.  **Reliability & Safety:**
    *   **Maturity:** The Shunting-yard algorithm is a well-established, robust method for parsing mathematical expressions.
    *   **Fault Tolerance:** The code explicitly validates input for invalid characters, unbalanced parentheses, and division by zero, raising standard Python exceptions (`ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError`) with clear, descriptive messages.
    *   **Security:** By implementing the parser manually and strictly avoiding `eval()` or similar functions, the code is protected against code injection vulnerabilities.
5.  **Usability (for Developers/Testability):** The public interface is a single, clean method: `calculate()`. The modular internal design allows for straightforward unit testing of each component (tokenization, parsing, evaluation) independently.
6.  **Readability and Documentation:** The code is heavily documented with docstrings, type hints, and comments explaining complex parts of the algorithm. Variable names are chosen to be descriptive and unambiguous.
