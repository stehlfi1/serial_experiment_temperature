Of course. As a senior software developer, I will create a robust, maintainable, and well-documented console-based calculator in Python. The design prioritizes adherence to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard for software quality.

### Design Philosophy and ISO/IEC 25010 Compliance

Before presenting the code, let's outline how the design choices map to the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard:

*   **Functional Suitability & Correctness:** The core logic uses a well-established two-pass algorithm: the **Shunting-Yard algorithm** to convert the infix expression to postfix (Reverse Polish Notation), followed by a simple stack-based evaluation of the postfix expression. This ensures correct handling of operator precedence and parentheses without ambiguity.
*   **Performance Efficiency:** The tokenization, Shunting-Yard conversion, and postfix evaluation all operate in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the expression string. This is highly efficient as each character and token is processed a constant number of times.
*   **Maintainability & Modularity:** The problem is broken down into distinct, logical components, each implemented as a private helper method within the `Calculator` class:
    1.  `_tokenize`: Handles the lexical analysis, breaking the raw string into a list of numbers and operators. This isolates the complexity of parsing numbers (including floats and negatives).
    2.  `_to_postfix`: Implements the Shunting-Yard algorithm. This isolates the parsing logic.
    3.  `_evaluate_postfix`: Performs the final calculation. This isolates the arithmetic logic.
    This separation makes the system easier to understand, modify, and debug. For instance, adding a new operator (like `^` for power) would only require minor changes in the `precedence` map and `_evaluate_postfix`.
*   **Reliability & Safety:** The code is designed to be robust against user error.
    *   **Input Validation:** Explicit checks are performed at each stage: invalid characters during tokenization, unbalanced parentheses during postfix conversion, and division by zero during evaluation.
    *   **Error Handling:** It uses standard Python exceptions (`ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError`) with clear, descriptive messages, allowing for graceful failure.
    *   **Security:** The explicit prohibition of `eval()` is honored, eliminating the risk of code injection attacks.
*   **Testability:** The modular design allows each component to be tested independently. The public `calculate` method provides a clear interface for integration and end-to-end testing.
*   **Readability & Documentation:** The code is written with clarity in mind, using descriptive variable names, type hints, and comprehensive docstrings for the class and its methods, explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values.

Here is the implementation of the `Calculator` class.

```python
import operator
from typing import List, Union

class Calculator:
    """
    A robust, console-based arithmetic calculator that evaluates string expressions.

    This class provides a safe and efficient way to compute mathematical expressions
    containing integers, floating-point numbers, parentheses, and the basic
    arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /). It adheres to standard operator precedence.

    The implementation uses the Shunting-Yard algorithm to convert infix expressions
    to a postfix (Reverse Polish Notation) queue, which is then evaluated. This
    approach avoids the use of Python's `eval()` function, enhancing security
    and providing more granular control over parsing and validation.

    ISO/IEC 25010 Compliance:
    - Functional Suitability: Correctly implements all specified arithmetic functionalities.
    - Performance Efficiency: Uses an O(n) algorithm for expression evaluation.
    - Maintainability: Logic is separated into modular helper methods for tokenizing,
      parsing (to postfix), and evaluating.
    - Reliability: Includes comprehensive validation and error handling for invalid
      input, malformed expressions, and division by zero.
    - Security: Does not use `eval()`, preventing code injection vulnerabilities.
    - Testability: The public `calculate` method and internal modular design
      facilitate straightforward unit testing.
