Of course. As a senior software developer, I understand the importance of building software that is not only functional but also robust, maintainable, and secure. Adhering to the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard is key to achieving this.

Here is a high-quality Python implementation of a console-based calculator that meets your requirements.

### Design Philosophy (Mapping to ISO/IEC 25010)

Before presenting the code, let's briefly outline how the design addresses the key quality characteristics of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard:

*   **Functional Suitability:** The code correctly implements all specified arithmetic operations, including operator precedence and parentheses, for both integers and floats.
*   **Performance Efficiency:** The implementation uses the **Shunting-yard algorithm** for parsing and a separate step for Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) evaluation. Both algorithms have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the expression, making them highly efficient for this task.
*   **Maintainability & Modularity:** The problem is broken down into three logical, private methods: `_tokenize`, `_to_rpn` (Shunting-yard), and `_evaluate_rpn`. This separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand, modify, and debug. For instance, adding a new operator would only require minor changes in the precedence map and the evaluation method.
*   **Reliability & Security:**
    *   **Error Handling (Reliability):** The code robustly validates input at every stage. It uses specific, built-in Python exceptions (`ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError`) to signal issues like invalid characters, unbalanced parentheses, malformed expressions, and division by zero.
    *   **Input Sanitization (Security):** By manually parsing the expression and explicitly forbidding `eval()`, we completely eliminate the risk of code injection attacks, a critical security consideration.
*   **Testability:** The `Calculator` class encapsulates all logic. The public `calculate` method provides a clear interface for unit testing. The internal modularity also allows for easier focused testing if desired.
*   **Usability (Readability & Documentation):** The code is thoroughly documented with docstrings for the class and all methods. Variable names are descriptive (e.g., `operator_stack`, `output_queue`), and comments are used to clarify complex logic, such as handling unary minus operators.

### Calculator Implementation

class Calculator:
    """
    A console-based arithmetic calculator that evaluates string expressions.

    This calculator adheres to standard operator precedence, supports parentheses,
    and handles integers, floating-point numbers, and negative values.

    The implementation uses the Shunting-yard algorithm to convert the infix
    expression to Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), which is then evaluated.
    This approach avoids the use of `eval()` and provides robust error handling.
