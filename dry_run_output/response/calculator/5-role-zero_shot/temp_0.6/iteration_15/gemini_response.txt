Of course. As a senior software developer, I understand the importance of creating code that is not only functional but also robust, maintainable, and secure. The following solution uses the Shunting-Yard algorithm for parsing and a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) evaluator, which is an efficient and standard approach that avoids the security risks of `eval()`.

The design adheres to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard by focusing on:

*   **Functional Suitability:** The code correctly implements all required arithmetic operations, including operator precedence and parentheses.
*   **Performance Efficiency:** The Shunting-Yard and RPN evaluation algorithms both have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of tokens in the expression, ensuring efficient processing.
*   **Maintainability & Modularity:** The logic is broken down into distinct, private methods for tokenization, parsing (Shunting-Yard), and evaluation (RPN). This separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand, modify, and test.
*   **Reliability & Security:** The code includes comprehensive validation and error handling for issues like invalid characters, unbalanced parentheses, malformed expressions, and division by zero. By implementing the parser manually, we completely avoid the security vulnerabilities associated with `eval()`.
*   **Testability:** The public interface `calculate(expression)` is simple and pure, making it straightforward to write unit tests for.
*   **Readability:** The code is documented with docstrings, type hints, and comments, and uses clear variable names to enhance understanding.

Here is the complete, high-quality Python implementation:

```python
import re
from collections import deque
from typing import List, Union

class Calculator:
    """
    A robust, console-based arithmetic calculator that evaluates string expressions.

    This class is designed with the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard
    for software quality in mind, emphasizing correctness, performance, security,
    and maintainability.

    It uses the Shunting-Yard algorithm to parse expressions, supporting:
    - Basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /
    - Parentheses for grouping: ()
    - Correct operator precedence.
    - Integer and floating-point numbers (including negative values).

    The implementation explicitly avoids the use of `eval()` to prevent
    code injection vulnerabilities.
