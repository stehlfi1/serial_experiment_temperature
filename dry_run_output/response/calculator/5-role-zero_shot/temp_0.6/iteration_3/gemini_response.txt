Of course. As a senior software developer, I understand the importance of building software that is not only functional but also robust, maintainable, and secure. Adhering to the principles of ISO/IEC 25010 is key to achieving this.

Here is a high-quality Python implementation of a console-based calculator that meets your requirements. I will use the **Shunting-yard algorithm** to parse the infix expression and convert it to Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), which can then be safely and efficiently evaluated. This approach avoids the security risks of `eval()` while correctly handling operator precedence and parentheses.

### Rationale for Design Choices (ISO/IEC 25010)

*   **Functional Suitability:** The code correctly implements all specified arithmetic operations, including parentheses and operator precedence, for both integers and floats.
*   **Performance Efficiency:** The Shunting-yard and RPN evaluation algorithms both have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of tokens in the expression. This is highly efficient for this task.
*   **Reliability & Safety:**
    *   **Fault Tolerance:** The code uses `try...except` blocks to gracefully handle and report specific errors like `ValueError` (for invalid characters, unbalanced parentheses, or malformed expressions) and `ZeroDivisionError`.
    *   **Security:** By implementing a custom parser and evaluator, we completely avoid `eval()`, thus preventing any possibility of code injection attacks.
*   **Maintainability & Testability:**
    *   **Modularity:** The problem is broken down into logical, private methods: `_tokenize`, `_to_rpn` (Shunting-yard), and `_evaluate_rpn`. Each part has a single responsibility.
    *   **Analyzability & Readability:** The code is documented with docstrings, type hints, and comments. Variable names are descriptive. Operator properties (precedence) are stored in a clear dictionary, making it easy to analyze or modify.
    *   **Testability:** Each private method can be unit-tested independently, making it easy to verify the tokenizer, the RPN conversion, and the RPN evaluation logic separately before testing the public `calculate` method.
*   **Usability:** Error messages are clear and informative, guiding the user on what went wrong with their input.

### Calculator Implementation

```python
import re
from typing import List, Union

class Calculator:
    """
    A safe, maintainable, and efficient arithmetic expression evaluator.

    This class implements a calculator that can parse and evaluate strings
    containing mathematical expressions. It adheres to standard operator
    precedence and supports parentheses.

    The implementation follows the ISO/IEC 25010 standard for software quality,
    focusing on reliability, security, maintainability, and performance.

    It uses the Shunting-yard algorithm to convert infix expressions to
    Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), which is then evaluated. This avoids the
    use of the insecure `eval()` function.
