Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a solution that not only meets the functional requirements but also exemplifies the principles of high-quality software development as outlined in ISO/IEC 25010.

The code is structured using an object-oriented approach, is well-documented, includes robust input validation for safety, and is designed for performance and testability.

***

### Explanation of Design Choices (Adherence to ISO/IEC 25010)

*   **Functional Suitability (Correctness):** Each drawing function implements the specified logic to produce the correct ASCII shape. The logic for proportional scaling in the triangle and the symmetrical padding in the pyramid ensures correctness for various dimensions.
*   **Performance Efficiency:** String concatenation in loops (`line += char`) is avoided. Instead, we use string multiplication (`symbol * width`) and `''.join()` with list comprehensions, which are significantly more performant for building strings in Python.
*   **Reliability & Security (Safety):** A private helper method, `_validate_inputs`, centralizes all input validation. It robustly checks for incorrect types (`TypeError`) and invalid values (`ValueError`), preventing runtime errors, crashes, or unexpected behavior from improper use. This makes the class safe to use.
*   **Maintainability (Modularity & Readability):**
    *   **Modularity:** The `AsciiArt` class encapsulates all drawing logic. The validation logic is further modularized into its own private method, adhering to the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle.
    *   **Readability:** The code uses clear, descriptive variable names. Comprehensive docstrings (following PEP 257) explain the purpose, parameters, return values, and potential errors for each method, making the API easy to understand and use.
*   **Usability & Testability:**
    *   Each function returns a string representation of the shape rather than printing it directly. This separation of concerns allows the calling code to decide what to do with the output (print, save to a file, etc.) and makes the functions pure and easily testable. You can simply assert that `art.draw_square(3, '*')` returns the expected string.
    *   The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block provides a clear demonstration of usage and allows the file to be executed as a script for a quick preview, while also being importable as a module without side effects.

This holistic approach results in code that is not just functional but also professional, scalable, and easy to maintain.
