Of course. As a senior software developer, I will generate a high-quality Python implementation for the ASCII Art application. The solution will be structured using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and will strictly adhere to the requirements of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard for software quality.

### ISO/IEC 25010 Compliance Breakdown

Before presenting the code, here is a brief explanation of how the implementation meets the key characteristics of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard:

*   **Functional Suitability (Correctness & Completeness):** The code correctly implements all specified drawing functions (`square`, `rectangle`, `parallelogram`, `triangle`, `pyramid`), producing accurate ASCII art for valid inputs.
*   **Performance Efficiency (Time Behaviour):** The implementation uses efficient methods for string manipulation. It leverages list comprehensions and the `str.join()` method, which are significantly faster for building multi-line strings than repeated string concatenation, avoiding quadratic time complexity.
*   **Maintainability (Modularity & Reusability):** The logic is encapsulated within the `AsciiArt` class. Common validation logic is abstracted into private helper methods (`_validate_dimension`, `_validate_symbol`) to avoid code duplication (DRY principle) and improve reusability. The `draw_square` method reuses `draw_rectangle`, further demonstrating this principle.
*   **Reliability (Maturity & Fault Tolerance):** The code is mature and robust. It anticipates and handles invalid inputs gracefully by performing strict validation at the beginning of each public method. It raises standard, descriptive exceptions (`ValueError`, `TypeError`), allowing the calling code to implement fault-tolerant error handling.
*   **Usability (Appropriateness Recognisability):** The public interface is clear, and its methods are named intuitively. The use of type hints and comprehensive docstrings makes the API easy to understand and use correctly.
*   **Security (Input Validation):** While not a security-critical application, it practices fundamental security hygiene by validating all user-provided inputs. This prevents unexpected behavior or potential injection issues if the output were ever redirected to a more complex system.
*   **Portability (Installability & Adaptability):** The code uses only Python's standard library, ensuring it can run on any system with a standard Python interpreter without additional dependencies.
*   **Testability:** The methods are pure functions (implemented as static methods) that depend only on their arguments and have no side effects. This makes them deterministic and extremely easy to unit test. For any given input, the output is always the same.
