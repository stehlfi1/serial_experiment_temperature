Of course. As a senior software developer, I'll provide a high-quality Python implementation for the ASCII Art generator, adhering to the specified requirements and the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard.

The code is structured using a class, includes comprehensive input validation, is well-documented, and is designed for maintainability and testability.

```python

    A class to generate various 2D ASCII art shapes.

    This class provides methods to draw simple geometric shapes like squares,
    rectangles, and pyramids using a specified character. It adheres to
    high-quality coding standards, focusing on correctness, safety, and
    maintainability as outlined by ISO/IEC 25010.
