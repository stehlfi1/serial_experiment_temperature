Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a high-quality Python implementation for the ASCII Art application. The solution will be structured within an object-oriented paradigm, emphasizing the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard: reliability, maintainability, performance efficiency, and usability.

The code includes:
*   A well-defined `AsciiArt` class.
*   Clear, type-hinted method signatures as per the requirements.
*   Robust input validation to ensure safety and reliability.
*   Efficient string-building techniques for performance.
*   Comprehensive docstrings and comments for readability and maintainability, facilitating ease of use and future modifications.
*   A demonstration block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) to showcase usage and allow for easy visual verification, enhancing testability.

A module for generating 2D ASCII art shapes.

This module provides the AsciiArt class, which implements methods to draw
various geometric shapes using a specified character. The implementation adheres
to high-quality code standards, focusing on correctness, efficiency, and
maintainability as outlined by ISO/IEC 25010.

class AsciiArt:
    """
    A class to generate various 2D ASCII art shapes.

    This class provides a suite of methods for drawing filled geometric shapes
    like squares, rectangles, and pyramids. It is designed with a focus on
    modularity, reusability, and safety, ensuring that all inputs are
    validated before processing.

    ISO/IEC 25010 Compliance Notes:
    - Functional Suitability: Provides correct shape-drawing functions.
    - Performance Efficiency: Uses efficient string joining over concatenation.
    - Reliability: Implements robust validation to handle faulty inputs gracefully.
    - Usability (for developers): Features a clean, well-documented API.
    - Maintainability: Code is modular, readable, and well-commented.
    - Portability: Uses only standard Python libraries.
