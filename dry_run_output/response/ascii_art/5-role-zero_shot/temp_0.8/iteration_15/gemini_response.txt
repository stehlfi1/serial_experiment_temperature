Of course. As a senior software developer, I will generate a high-quality Python implementation for the ASCII Art application. The code will be structured using Object-Oriented Principles and will adhere to the specified functional and quality requirements, reflecting the best practices of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard.

### Conformance with ISO/IEC 25010

The provided solution addresses the key characteristics of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard:

*   **Functional Suitability (Correctness):** Each method correctly generates the specified ASCII shape according to the requirements. Input validation ensures functional completeness and correctness by handling invalid cases gracefully.
*   **Performance Efficiency:** The implementation uses efficient string multiplication and list comprehensions with `str.join()`, which is significantly more performant for building multi-line strings than repeated concatenation.
*   **Compatibility:** The code uses standard Python 3 features and built-in types, making it highly compatible across different platforms where Python is installed.
*   **Usability:** The class interface is clear and predictable. Error messages are user-friendly and clearly state the nature of the input error.
*   **Reliability (Maturity, Fault Tolerance):** The code is reliable due to robust input validation. It anticipates incorrect usage (e.g., negative dimensions, invalid symbols) and raises appropriate, explicit errors (`ValueError`, `TypeError`) instead of crashing or producing malformed output. This demonstrates fault tolerance.
*   **Security:** While this is a simple console application, the principle of "Safety" is addressed by validating inputs to prevent potential misuse or unexpected behavior. No `eval()` or other unsafe operations are used.
*   **Maintainability (Modularity, Reusability, Testability, Readability):**
    *   **Modularity:** The `AsciiArt` class encapsulates all drawing logic, separating it from any potential user interface code. The internal validation logic is further modularized into a private helper method (`_validate_inputs`) to adhere to the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle.
    *   **Reusability:** The class and its methods can be easily imported and reused in other applications.
    *   **Testability:** The methods are pure functions—they have no side effects and their output depends solely on their input. This makes them trivial to unit test.
    *   **Readability:** The code is documented with clear docstrings, uses descriptive variable names, and includes type hints, making it easy for other developers to understand and maintain.
*   **Portability:** The code is written in pure Python with no platform-specific dependencies, ensuring it can run on any system with a Python interpreter.

Here is the complete, high-quality Python code.
