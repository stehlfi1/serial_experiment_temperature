Of course. As a senior software developer, I will generate a high-quality Python application for ASCII art that adheres to the specified requirements and the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard for software quality.

The code below is structured within an `AsciiArt` class, promoting **modularity** and **reusability**. It includes comprehensive input validation for **safety** and **reliability**, and detailed docstrings for **readability** and **maintainability**. The algorithms used are efficient, focusing on **performance**, and the methods return strings, which ensures high **testability**.

```python
"""
A module for generating 2D ASCII art shapes.

This module provides the AsciiArt class, which contains methods for drawing
various geometric shapes using ASCII characters. The implementation prioritizes
code quality, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.

ISO/IEC 25010 Compliance Notes:
- Functional Suitability: The code correctly implements the required drawing functions.
- Performance Efficiency: Uses efficient string building techniques (`str.join`).
- Reliability (Fault Tolerance/Maturity): Robust input validation prevents crashes
  from invalid arguments.
- Usability: The class-based API is clear and easy to use.
- Maintainability (Modularity, Reusability, Testability): The code is organized
  into a class, with a helper for validation, promoting reuse. Methods return
  strings, making them easy to unit test.
- Security: No use of unsafe functions like eval().
