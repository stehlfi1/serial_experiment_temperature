Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a Python solution for the ASCII art application that is robust, maintainable, and adheres to the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard for software quality.

### Adherence to ISO/IEC 25010

The provided code is designed with the following quality characteristics in mind:

*   **Functional Suitability:** The code correctly implements all specified drawing functions (`draw_square`, `draw_rectangle`, etc.), ensuring it behaves as expected.
*   **Performance Efficiency:** It utilizes efficient string operations (e.g., string multiplication and `str.join()`) and list comprehensions to generate the ASCII art, minimizing resource usage and execution time.
*   **Maintainability:**
    *   **Modularity:** The logic is encapsulated within the `AsciiArt` class. A private helper method (`_validate_inputs`) centralizes validation logic, reducing redundancy. Each shape is drawn by a distinct method, making the system easy to understand and modify.
    *   **Reusability:** The `AsciiArt` class can be easily imported and used in other parts of a larger application. The validation logic is reused across all public methods.
    *   **Testability:** Each drawing method is a pure function—its output depends only on its inputs, with no side effects. This makes unit testing straightforward.
    *   **Readability:** The code employs clear variable names, type hints, and comprehensive docstrings to explain the purpose, parameters, and return values of each component.
*   **Reliability:**
    *   **Fault Tolerance:** The application is protected against invalid inputs through rigorous validation. It raises descriptive, standard exceptions (`ValueError`, `TypeError`), allowing calling code to handle errors gracefully. This prevents crashes or undefined behavior.
*   **Usability:** The public API is clear and intuitive. Error messages are user-friendly, guiding the developer on how to correct the input.

Here is the high-quality Python code for the ASCII art generator.
