Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a high-quality Python implementation for the ASCII art generator, adhering to the specified requirements and focusing on the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard.

The code is structured within an `AsciiArt` class, ensuring modularity and reusability. Input validation is centralized to enhance safety and maintainability. Each method is documented with clear docstrings, and the implementation uses efficient string-building techniques for optimal performance.

Here is the complete, high-quality Python code:

```python
"""
A module for generating 2D ASCII art shapes.

This module provides the AsciiArt class, which implements methods to draw
various geometric shapes using user-specified symbols. The implementation
adheres to high-quality coding standards, focusing on correctness,
efficiency, safety, and maintainability as outlined by ISO/IEC 25010.
