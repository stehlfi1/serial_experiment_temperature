Of course. As a senior software developer focused on creating high-quality, maintainable code, I will provide a Python implementation for the ASCII art generator that adheres to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard and your specified requirements.

The solution is encapsulated within an `AsciiArt` class, ensuring modularity and reusability. It includes robust input validation for safety, comprehensive documentation for readability, and efficient algorithms for performance.

Here is the complete, high-quality Python code:

```python
"""
A module for generating 2D ASCII art shapes.

This module provides the AsciiArt class, which implements methods to draw
various geometric shapes using ASCII characters. It is designed with a focus
on code quality, adhering to principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard,
including correctness, performance, safety, and maintainability.
"""

class AsciiArt:
    """
    A class for generating 2D ASCII art shapes.

    This class provides a collection of methods to draw various geometric shapes
    using ASCII characters. It emphasizes correctness, performance, safety,
    and maintainability. All methods perform validation on input parameters
    to ensure functional safety and robustness.

    ISO/IEC 25010 Compliance:
    - Functional Suitability: Correctly draws specified shapes.
    - Performance Efficiency: Uses efficient string operations (e.g., `str.join`).
    - Maintainability: Modular design with helper methods and clear documentation.
    - Reliability (Fault Tolerance): Gracefully handles invalid inputs via exceptions.
    - Testability: Methods are pure functions, facilitating easy unit testing.
    - Usability & Readability: Clear API with comprehensive docstrings and type hints.
