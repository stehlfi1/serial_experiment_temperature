Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a high-quality Python implementation for the ASCII art generator. The solution will be structured within a class, adhere to the specified interface, and incorporate best practices for maintainability, readability, and robustness, in line with the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard.

Here is the complete, well-documented, and efficient Python code.

```python
"""
A module for generating 2D ASCII art shapes.

This module provides the AsciiArt class, which implements methods to draw
various geometric shapes using ASCII characters. The implementation prioritizes
code quality, adhering to principles of modularity, efficiency, and safety
as outlined in the ISO/IEC 25010 standard.

    A class for generating various 2D ASCII art shapes.

    This class provides a clean interface for creating string representations of

    reliability and ease of use, with built-in validation to ensure correct
    and predictable behavior.

    Methods are pure in the sense that they take inputs and return a string
    output without side effects, making them easily testable and reusable.
