Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a high-quality Python implementation for the ASCII art generator, adhering to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard and best practices.

The code is structured using an `AsciiArt` class for modularity and reusability. It includes comprehensive input validation for safety and reliability, detailed docstrings for readability and maintainability, and efficient algorithms for performance.
