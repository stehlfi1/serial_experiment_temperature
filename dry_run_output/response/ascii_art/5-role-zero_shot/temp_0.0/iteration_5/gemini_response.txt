Of course. Here is a high-quality Python implementation for the console-based 2D ASCII Art application, designed according to your specifications and adhering to the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard.

***

### ISO/IEC 25010 Compliance Analysis

This implementation addresses the characteristics of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard as follows:

*   **Functional Suitability:** The code correctly implements all specified drawing functions (`draw_square`, `draw_rectangle`, etc.), meeting the functional requirements.
*   **Performance Efficiency:** It uses efficient string operations (e.g., `str.center()`, `''.join()` with list comprehensions) instead of inefficient string concatenation in loops, ensuring optimal performance for the given task.
*   **Maintainability:**
    *   **Modularity:** The logic is encapsulated within the `AsciiArt` class. A private helper `_validate_inputs` is used to avoid code duplication, making the code easier to maintain.
    *   **Reusability:** `draw_square` reuses the logic from `draw_rectangle`, demonstrating component reuse.
    *   **Testability:** Methods are pure functions (output depends only on input), making them easy to unit test.
*   **Reliability:**
    *   **Maturity:** The code is stable and provides the expected output.
    *   **Fault Tolerance:** Robust input validation using a centralized `_validate_inputs` method prevents crashes from invalid data (e.g., non-positive dimensions, incorrect symbol types) by raising appropriate errors.
*   **Usability:**
    *   **Learnability:** The public API is simple and intuitive.
    *   **Operability:** The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block provides a clear example of how to use the class.
*   **Readability and Documentation:** The code is thoroughly documented with PEP 257 compliant docstrings, type hints, and clear variable names, making it easy to understand and use.
