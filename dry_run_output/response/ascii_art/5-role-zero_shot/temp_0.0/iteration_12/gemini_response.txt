Of course. As a senior software developer focused on creating high-quality, maintainable code, I will provide a solution that adheres to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard and Python best practices.

The following code implements the `AsciiArt` class with the required shape-drawing functions.

### Key Design Choices for Code Quality (ISO/IEC 25010)

*   **Functional Suitability & Correctness:** Each drawing function implements the specified logic to produce the correct ASCII shape. Edge cases (like a width/height of 1) are handled correctly by the algorithms.
*   **Reliability & Safety:** Robust input validation is performed by private helper methods (`_validate_symbol`, `_validate_dimensions`). This prevents the program from entering an invalid state or producing unexpected output due to incorrect inputs (e.g., negative dimensions, multi-character symbols). It raises standard, descriptive errors (`ValueError`, `TypeError`).
*   **Performance Efficiency:** The code uses efficient string operations. Instead of repeated string concatenation (which can be slow), it builds a list of lines and then joins them with `'\n'.join()`. This is the standard, performant way to build multi-line strings in Python.
*   **Maintainability & Modularity:**
    *   The logic is encapsulated within the `AsciiArt` class.
    *   Validation logic is separated into private helper methods (`_validate_...`), adhering to the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle. This makes it easy to modify validation rules in one place.
    *   `draw_square` reuses `draw_rectangle`, which reduces code duplication and makes the codebase easier to maintain.
*   **Usability & Testability:** The class has a clear, well-documented public API. Each method is a pure function—its output depends only on its inputs—making the class straightforward to use and simple to unit test.
*   **Readability and Documentation (Portability):** The code is written using standard Python 3 features, ensuring it can run on any system with a Python interpreter. It includes comprehensive docstrings (following PEP 257), type hints, and clear variable names to make the code easy to understand and use.

Here is the implementation:
