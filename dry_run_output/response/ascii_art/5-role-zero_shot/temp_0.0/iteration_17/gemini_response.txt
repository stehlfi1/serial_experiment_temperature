Of course. As a senior software developer focused on creating high-quality, maintainable code, I will generate a Python solution that meets your requirements while adhering to the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard.

The following code provides the `AsciiArt` class, which is designed for correctness, efficiency, safety, and maintainability.

- **Modularity & Reusability:** A private helper method, `_validate_inputs`, centralizes all input validation, preventing code duplication and making it easy to maintain.
- **Reliability & Safety:** Inputs for dimensions and symbols are rigorously checked to prevent common errors, raising descriptive `ValueError` exceptions as required.
- **Performance Efficiency:** String construction uses list comprehensions and the `str.join()` method, which is more memory and time-efficient than repeated string concatenation in a loop.
- **Readability & Documentation:** The code is thoroughly documented with docstrings for the class and each method, explaining their purpose, parameters, return values, and potential errors. Variable names are clear and descriptive.
- **Testability:** Each method is a pure function that takes inputs and returns a string, making it straightforward to write unit tests by asserting the output against expected string literals.

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
import typing

class AsciiArt:
    """
    A class for generating 2D ASCII art shapes.

    This class provides a collection of methods to draw various geometric shapes
    using ASCII characters. It is designed with a focus on code quality,
    adhering to principles from the ISO/IEC 25010 standard, including:
    - Functional Suitability: Correctly generates specified shapes.
    - Reliability: Robust input validation to prevent errors.
    - Performance Efficiency: Uses efficient string-building techniques.
    - Maintainability: Clean, modular, and well-documented code.
    - Testability: Methods return predictable string outputs for easy testing.
