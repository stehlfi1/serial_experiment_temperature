Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a high-quality Python implementation for the ASCII Art generator. The solution is structured using Object-Oriented principles and adheres to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard by focusing on correctness, efficiency, security, maintainability, and readability.

Here is the complete, well-documented code:

```python
"""
A module for generating 2D ASCII art shapes.

This module provides the AsciiArt class, which contains methods for drawing
various geometric shapes using a specified character. The implementation
prioritizes code quality characteristics as defined by ISO/IEC 25010,
including functional suitability, performance efficiency, reliability,
and maintainability.

Example:
    art_generator = AsciiArt()
    square = art_generator.draw_square(5, '#')
    print(square)
"""

    A class for generating 2D ASCII art shapes.

    This class provides a suite of methods to draw various geometric shapes
    as multi-line strings. It is designed for reliability and ease of use,
    incorporating robust input validation to prevent common errors.

    The methods in this class are self-contained and could be defined as static,
    but are implemented as instance methods to align with OOP principles and
    allow for future extensibility (e.g., setting a default symbol in the
    constructor).
