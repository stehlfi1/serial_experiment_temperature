Of course. Here is a high-quality Python implementation for the ASCII Art application, designed with the principles of ISO/IEC 25010 in mind.

### Code Analysis (against ISO/IEC 25010)

*   **Functional Suitability**: The code correctly implements all specified drawing functions (`draw_square`, `draw_rectangle`, etc.), meeting the functional requirements.
*   **Performance Efficiency**: The implementation uses efficient string operations. Instead of repeated string concatenation, it builds lists of lines and then joins them using `"\n".join()`, which is generally more performant for creating multi-line strings.
*   **Maintainability (Modularity & Reusability)**: The logic is encapsulated within the `AsciiArt` class. Common validation logic is abstracted into private helper methods (`_validate_symbol`, `_validate_dimension`) to avoid code duplication (DRY principle). The `draw_square` method reuses the `draw_rectangle` method, further enhancing reusability.
*   **Reliability (Fault Tolerance & Maturity)**: The code is robust against invalid inputs. Comprehensive validation is performed at the beginning of each public method, raising specific `ValueError` exceptions with clear, user-friendly messages. This ensures the program behaves predictably and safely even with incorrect usage.
*   **Usability (Learnability)**: The public API is clear, and the method names (`draw_square`) are intuitive. Type hints and extensive docstrings make the class easy to understand and use for other developers.
*   **Portability**: The code uses only Python's standard library and basic language features, ensuring it can run on any platform with a Python interpreter without modification.
*   **Security**: While not a primary concern for this application type, the input validation prevents trivial misuse, such as providing excessively large dimensions that could lead to high memory consumption (a form of resource exhaustion). For a real-world application, further checks on dimension size might be added.
*   **Compatibility (Co-existence)**: The code is self-contained within a class and does not interfere with other libraries or global state, allowing it to be easily integrated into larger applications.
