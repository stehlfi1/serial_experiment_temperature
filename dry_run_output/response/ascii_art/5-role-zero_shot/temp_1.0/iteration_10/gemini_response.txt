Of course. As a senior software developer, I will generate a high-quality Python implementation for the ASCII Art application. The code adheres to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard by focusing on modularity, reliability, efficiency, and maintainability.

The solution includes:
*   An `AsciiArt` class encapsulating all drawing logic, as requested.
*   Implementation of all required shape functions (`draw_square`, `draw_rectangle`, etc.).
*   A private static method for robust, reusable input validation, preventing code duplication.
*   Comprehensive docstrings and type hinting for clarity and maintainability (Readability).
*   Efficient use of string operations and list comprehensions for optimal performance (Performance Efficiency).
*   Graceful error handling using built-in exceptions for invalid inputs (Reliability, Safety).
*   A `if __name__ == "__main__"` block to demonstrate usage and serve as a basic integration test (Testability).

Here is the complete, high-quality Python code:
