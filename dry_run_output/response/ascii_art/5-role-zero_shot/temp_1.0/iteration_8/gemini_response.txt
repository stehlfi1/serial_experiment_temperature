Of course. Here is a high-quality Python implementation for the ASCII Art application, designed according to your specifications and adhering to the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard.

```python
"""
ascii_art.py

A module for generating various 2D ASCII art shapes.

This module provides the AsciiArt class, which contains methods for drawing
filled geometric shapes using a specified character. The implementation focuses on
correctness, efficiency, and maintainability, following Python best practices and
adhering to the principles outlined in ISO/IEC 25010.

Key Features:
- OOP design with a dedicated AsciiArt class.
- Generation of squares, rectangles, parallelograms, triangles, and pyramids.
- Robust input validation to ensure data integrity and prevent errors.
- Clean, readable, and well-documented code with type hints.
- Efficient string generation techniques.

Example:
    art_generator = AsciiArt()
    square = art_generator.draw_square(5, '#')
    print(square)
