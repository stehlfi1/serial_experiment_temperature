Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a Python solution for the ASCII art generator that adheres to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard, emphasizing maintainability, robustness, and efficiency.

The following code provides the `AsciiArt` class, which encapsulates all drawing logic. It includes comprehensive input validation, clear documentation, and efficient algorithms for generating the shapes.

***

### ISO/IEC 25010 Compliance Breakdown

Before presenting the code, here is a brief overview of how it meets the key characteristics of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard:

*   **Functional Suitability (Correctness):** The drawing algorithms are implemented to produce the correct shapes as per the requirements for all valid inputs.
*   **Performance Efficiency:** String operations are optimized. Instead of slow string concatenation in loops, lines are generated and then combined using `str.join()`, which is highly efficient for building multi-line strings.
*   **Compatibility (Interoperability):** The code uses standard Python 3 features and built-in types, ensuring it can be integrated into other Python applications without modification.
*   **Usability (Learnability, Operability):** The class has a clear, well-documented public API. The descriptive method names and docstrings make it easy for other developers to learn and use.
*   **Reliability (Maturity, Fault Tolerance):** Robust input validation is implemented at the beginning of each function, preventing crashes from invalid inputs and providing clear `TypeError` and `ValueError` exceptions. This makes the component resilient.
*   **Security (Integrity):** While not a security-critical application, the strong input validation protects against basic injection-like issues (e.g., using control characters as symbols) and ensures data integrity within the function's scope.
*   **Maintainability (Modularity, Reusability, Testability):**
    *   **Modularity:** The logic is encapsulated within the `AsciiArt` class. A private helper method, `_validate_inputs`, centralizes validation logic, reducing code duplication.
    *   **Reusability:** The `draw_square` method reuses the `draw_rectangle` method, demonstrating code reuse. The class itself is reusable in any application that needs to generate ASCII art.
    *   **Testability:** Each method is a "pure function" in that its output depends solely on its inputs, with no side effects. This design makes writing unit tests straightforward.
*   **Portability (Adaptability, Installability):** The code requires only a standard Python installation, making it highly portable across different operating systems.
