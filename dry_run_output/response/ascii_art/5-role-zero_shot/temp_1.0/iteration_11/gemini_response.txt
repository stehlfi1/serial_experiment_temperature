Of course. As a senior software developer, I'll provide a high-quality, maintainable, and well-documented Python implementation for the ASCII Art generator, keeping the principles of the **ISO/IEC 25010** standard in mind.

### Adherence to ISO/IEC 25010

The provided solution emphasizes several key quality characteristics defined by the standard:

*   **Functional Suitability:** The code correctly implements all specified drawing functions (`draw_square`, `draw_rectangle`, etc.), ensuring it behaves as required.
*   **Reliability & Security:** Robust input validation is implemented to handle invalid arguments gracefully by raising standard exceptions (`ValueError`, `TypeError`), preventing unexpected crashes or behavior. This directly addresses **Fault Tolerance** and **Maturity**.
*   **Performance Efficiency:** The code uses efficient string-building techniques, such as list comprehensions and the `str.join()` method, to minimize resource utilization, particularly for larger shapes.
*   **Maintainability:**
    *   **Modularity:** Logic is encapsulated within the `AsciiArt` class. Input validation is centralized in private helper methods (`_validate_symbol`, `_validate_dimension`), promoting code reuse and simplifying future modifications.
    *   **Analysability & Modifiability:** The code is documented with clear docstrings, type hints, and self-explanatory variable names, making it easy to understand, debug, and extend with new shapes.
*   **Testability:** Each drawing method is a pure function—its output depends only on its inputs, with no side effects. This design makes the methods independently verifiable through unit tests.

Here is the complete, high-quality implementation:
