Of course. Here is a high-quality Python implementation of a console-based ASCII art application, designed according to ISO/IEC 25010 principles and best practices.

```python
"""
This module provides the AsciiArt class for generating 2D ASCII art shapes.

The implementation adheres to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard for software quality,
focusing on:
- Functional Suitability: Correctly generates specified ASCII shapes.
- Performance Efficiency: Uses efficient string operations and algorithms.
- Maintainability: Code is modular, readable, and well-documented.
- Reliability: Robust input validation prevents errors and crashes.
- Usability: A simple and predictable interface (API).
- Testability: Methods are pure functions, facilitating easy unit testing.
