Of course. As a senior software developer, I will generate a high-quality Python application for drawing ASCII art that adheres to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard by focusing on maintainability, reliability, efficiency, and usability.

Here is the complete implementation, including the `AsciiArt` class, robust input validation, clear documentation, and a demonstration of its usage.

```python
import math
from typing import Dict, Optional


class AsciiArt:
    """
    A class for generating 2D ASCII art shapes.

    This class provides a collection of methods to draw various geometric shapes
    using a specified character. It is designed with a focus on code quality,
    adhering to principles of readability, maintainability, and robustness as
    outlined in the ISO/IEC 25010 standard.

    Key features include:
    - Object-Oriented Design: Encapsulates drawing logic within a class.
    - Robust Validation: Protects against invalid inputs to ensure reliability.
    - Clear Interface: Methods are clearly named with type hints and docstrings.
    - Efficiency: Uses efficient string-building techniques.
