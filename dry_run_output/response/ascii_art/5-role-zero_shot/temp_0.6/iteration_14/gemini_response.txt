Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a high-quality Python implementation for the ASCII Art generator. The code adheres to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard by emphasizing maintainability, efficiency, reliability, and usability.

Here is the complete solution, including the `AsciiArt` class, comprehensive docstrings, input validation, and a demonstration of its usage.

```python
import math
from typing import Optional

class AsciiArt:
    """
    A class for generating 2D ASCII art shapes.

    This class provides a collection of methods to draw various geometric shapes
    using a specified character. It is designed with a focus on code quality,
    adhering to principles of modularity, readability, and reliability. All
    methods validate their inputs to ensure robustness and return the generated
se    shape as a multi-line string.

    ISO/IEC 25010 Compliance:
    - Functional Suitability: Provides correct shape generation.
    - Performance Efficiency: Uses efficient string-building techniques.
    - Reliability: Implements comprehensive input validation and error handling.
    - Maintainability: Features a modular design with clear, documented, and
      testable methods.
