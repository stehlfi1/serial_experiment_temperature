Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a high-quality Python implementation for the ASCII art generator. The solution will be structured within a class, following OOP principles, and will adhere to the specified requirements, focusing on the quality characteristics outlined in ISO/IEC 25010.

Here is the complete, well-documented, and maintainable Python code:

```python
import math
from typing import Dict


class AsciiArt:
    """
    A class for generating 2D ASCII art shapes.

    This class provides methods to draw various geometric shapes using
    a specified printable ASCII character. It is designed with a focus on
    correctness, performance, safety, and maintainability, aligning with the
    principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard for software quality.

    Methods are provided for drawing squares, rectangles, parallelograms,
    triangles, and pyramids. All methods include robust input validation
    to ensure fault tolerance and predictable behavior.
    """

    def _validate_inputs(self, symbol: str, **dimensions: int) -> None:
        """
        Private helper to validate common inputs for drawing methods.

        This method centralizes input validation to ensure consistency and
        adherence to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, which enhances
        maintainability.

        Args:
            symbol (str): The character to use for drawing.
            **dimensions (int): A keyword dictionary of dimension names and their
                                integer values (e.g., width=5, height=10).

        Raises:
            TypeError: If a dimension is not an integer or the symbol is not a string.
            ValueError: If a dimension is non-positive, or if the symbol is not a
                        single, printable, non-whitespace character.
        """
        # --- Symbol Validation ---

            raise TypeError("Symbol must be a string.")

                raise ValueError(f"Dimension '{name}' must be a positive integer.")

    def draw_square(self, width: int, symbol: str) -> str:
        """
        Draws a filled square.

        draw_rectangle method, improving maintainability.
