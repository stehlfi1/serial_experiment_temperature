Of course. As a senior software developer, I understand the importance of creating code that is not only functional but also robust, maintainable, and well-documented, aligning with the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard.

Here is the high-quality Python code for the console-based 2D ASCII art application.

```python
"""
A module for generating 2D ASCII art shapes.

This module provides the AsciiArt class, which contains methods for drawing
various geometric shapes using printable ASCII characters. The implementation
focuses on correctness, efficiency, safety, and maintainability.
