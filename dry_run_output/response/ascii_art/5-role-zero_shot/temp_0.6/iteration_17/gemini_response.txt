Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a solution that not only meets the functional requirements but also exemplifies the principles of high-quality software design as outlined by ISO/IEC 25010.

The code will be structured within a class (`AsciiArt`), ensuring modularity. It will include robust input validation for safety and reliability. Each method will be a pure function, returning a string, which makes the code highly testable. Efficiency is achieved by using optimized string operations like multiplication and `join`. Finally, comprehensive docstrings and clear variable names ensure readability and maintainability.

Here is the complete, high-quality Python implementation.

```python
"""
ascii_art_generator.py

This module provides the AsciiArt class, a tool for generating various 2D shapes
using ASCII characters.

The implementation prioritizes the software quality characteristics defined in
the ISO/IEC 25010 standard:
- **Functional Suitability**: Correctly generates the specified shapes.
- **Performance Efficiency**: Uses efficient string operations to generate art.
- **Reliability**: Implements robust validation to handle invalid inputs gracefully.
- **Maintainability**: Features a modular, object-oriented design with clear,
  documented, and readable code, making it easy to understand and modify.
- **Testability**: Public methods are pure functions, facilitating straightforward
  unit testing.
