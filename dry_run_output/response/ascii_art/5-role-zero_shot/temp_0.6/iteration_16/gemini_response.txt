Of course. As a senior software developer, I understand the importance of creating code that is not only functional but also reliable, maintainable, and efficient. Here is a high-quality Python implementation for the ASCII art generator, designed with the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard in mind.

The code is structured using an object-oriented approach, includes comprehensive input validation, and is thoroughly documented to ensure clarity and ease of use.

```python
"""
A module for generating 2D ASCII art shapes.

This module provides the AsciiArt class, which offers a suite of tools for
creating console-based geometric shapes. The implementation prioritizes
correctness, efficiency, and maintainability, adhering to best practices
in software development.
"""

from typing import Tuple


class AsciiArt:
    """
    A class to generate various 2D ASCII art shapes.

    This class provides methods to draw common geometric shapes like squares,
    rectangles, and pyramids using user-specified symbols. It adheres to
    high-quality code standards, including robust input validation and clear
    documentation, aligning with ISO/IEC 25010 principles for software quality.

    Characteristics Addressed (ISO/IEC 25010):
    - Functional Suitability: Implements all required drawing functions correctly.
    - Reliability (Fault Tolerance): Protects against invalid inputs through
      rigorous validation, preventing crashes and undefined behavior.
    - Performance Efficiency: Uses efficient string manipulation techniques
      (e.g., list comprehensions and `str.join`) for optimal performance.
    - Maintainability (Modularity, Reusability): Encapsulates validation logic
      in private helper methods to avoid code duplication. Each shape is drawn
      in its own modular method.
    - Usability (Readability, Learnability): Features a clean interface with
      descriptive docstrings, type hints, and clear parameter names.
