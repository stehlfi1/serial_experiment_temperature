Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a high-quality Python implementation for the ASCII art generator that adheres to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard, emphasizing modularity, safety, and maintainability.

Here is the complete, well-documented code:

```python

"""
A module for generating 2D ASCII art shapes.

This module provides the AsciiArt class, which implements methods to draw
various geometric shapes using ASCII characters. The implementation prioritizes
code quality, adhering to principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard, including
functional suitability, reliability, and maintainability.
