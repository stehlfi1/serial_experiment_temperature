Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a high-quality Python implementation for the ASCII art generator.

The following solution adheres to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard by focusing on key quality characteristics:

*   **Functional Suitability:** The code correctly implements all specified drawing functions.
*   **Performance Efficiency:** String construction is optimized using list comprehensions and the `join` method, which is more efficient than repeated string concatenation.
*   **Reliability & Security:** Robust input validation is implemented to handle invalid arguments gracefully, preventing crashes and incorrect outputs (Fault Tolerance).
*   **Maintainability:** The code is modular, with a clear separation of concerns. A private helper method (`_validate_inputs`) handles common validation logic to avoid duplication (DRY principle).
*   **Usability & Testability:** The class-based design provides a clear and reusable API. Each method is a pure function that returns a string, making it straightforward to integrate and unit test.
*   **Readability:** The code is documented with clear docstrings, type hints, and self-explanatory variable names, making it easy to understand and modify.

Here is the complete implementation:
