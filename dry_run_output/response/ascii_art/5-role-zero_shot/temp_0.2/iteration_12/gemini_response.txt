Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a high-quality Python implementation for the ASCII art generator that adheres to the specified requirements and the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard.

The code is structured within an `AsciiArt` class, ensuring modularity and reusability. Each drawing function includes robust input validation for safety and reliability. The implementation uses efficient string operations for performance and is thoroughly documented for readability and maintainability.

Here is the complete, production-ready code:

```python

A module for generating 2D ASCII art shapes.

This module provides the AsciiArt class, which contains methods for drawing
various geometric shapes using ASCII characters. It is designed with a focus
