Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a high-quality Python implementation for the ASCII art generator that adheres to the specified requirements and the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard.

The code is structured using an `AsciiArt` class for modularity and reusability. It includes a static helper method for input validation to ensure safety and avoid code duplication. Each drawing method is efficient, using list comprehensions and `str.join()` instead of slow string concatenation in loops. The code is thoroughly documented with docstrings for readability and maintainability, making it easy to understand and test.

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
import math
from typing import Dict


class AsciiArt:
    """
    A class to generate various 2D ASCII art shapes.

    This class provides methods to draw simple geometric shapes like squares,
    rectangles, and pyramids using ASCII characters. It is designed with a focus
    on code quality, adhering to principles from the ISO/IEC 25010 standard,
    including functional suitability, performance efficiency, reliability (safety),
    and maintainability.

    Methods:
        draw_square(width, symbol): Draws a filled square.
        draw_rectangle(width, height, symbol): Draws a filled rectangle.
        draw_parallelogram(width, height, symbol): Draws a filled parallelogram.
        draw_triangle(width, height, symbol): Draws a filled right-angled triangle.
        draw_pyramid(height, symbol): Draws a filled symmetrical pyramid.
    """

    @staticmethod
    def _validate_inputs(symbol: str, **dimensions: int) -> None:
        """
        Validates the symbol and dimension inputs for drawing methods.

        This is a private static helper method to ensure inputs are safe and
        correct, promoting reliability and preventing common errors.

            symbol: The character to use for drawing.
            **dimensions: A keyword dictionary of dimensions (e.g., width, height).

            TypeError: If the symbol is not a string or a dimension is not an integer.
            ValueError: If the symbol is not a single character, is whitespace,
                        or if a dimension is not a positive integer.
