Of course. Here is a high-quality Python implementation for a console-based 2D ASCII art application, designed according to your specifications and adhering to the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard.

The code is structured within an `AsciiArt` class, ensuring modularity and reusability. It includes robust input validation for safety, comprehensive docstrings for readability and maintainability, and efficient algorithms for performance.

```python
"""
A module for generating 2D ASCII art shapes.

This module provides the AsciiArt class, which implements methods to draw
various geometric shapes using ASCII characters. The implementation prioritizes
code quality, maintainability, and adherence to software engineering best
practices as outlined by ISO/IEC 25010.

Classes:
    AsciiArt: A class to generate ASCII art representations of shapes.

    A class to generate various 2D ASCII art shapes.

    This class encapsulates the logic for creating string representations of

    all inputs are validated to prevent errors and produce correct, predictable
    output. The methods are designed to be pure, returning a string result
    without side effects, which enhances testability and reusability.
