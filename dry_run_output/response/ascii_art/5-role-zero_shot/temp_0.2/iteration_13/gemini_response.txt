Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a high-quality Python implementation for the ASCII art generator, adhering to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard and best practices.

The code is structured using an object-oriented approach, with a focus on modularity, safety, and readability. Input validation is handled centrally to ensure reliability, and the drawing algorithms are implemented efficiently. Comprehensive documentation is included to enhance maintainability and usability.

"""
A Python module for generating 2D ASCII art shapes.

This module provides the AsciiArt class, which implements methods to draw
various geometric shapes using ASCII characters. The implementation prioritizes
code quality, adhering to principles of correctness, performance, safety,
