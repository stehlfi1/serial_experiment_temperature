Of course. As a senior software developer, I will generate a high-quality Python solution for the ASCII art application. The code will be structured using Object-Oriented principles and will adhere to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard, emphasizing maintainability, reliability, and efficiency.

Here is the complete, well-documented Python code.

```python
"""
A module for generating 2D ASCII art shapes.

This module provides the AsciiArt class, which implements methods for drawing
various geometric shapes using ASCII characters. The implementation focuses on
code quality, adhering to principles outlined in ISO/IEC 25010, including
reliability, maintainability, and efficiency.
