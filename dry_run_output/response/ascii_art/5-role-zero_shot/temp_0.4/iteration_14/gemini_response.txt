Of course. As a senior software developer focused on high-quality, maintainable code, I will provide a solution that adheres to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard and follows Python best practices.

The code below is structured using an object-oriented approach, includes robust input validation, and is thoroughly documented to ensure readability and ease of maintenance.

***

### ISO/IEC 25010 Compliance Breakdown

*   **Functional Suitability (Correctness, Completeness):** The code correctly implements all specified drawing functions (`square`, `rectangle`, `parallelogram`, `triangle`, `pyramid`) and returns the expected ASCII art strings.
*   **Performance Efficiency (Time Behaviour):** The implementation uses efficient methods for string generation, such as list comprehensions and `str.join()`, avoiding costly string concatenation in loops.
*   **Maintainability (Modularity, Reusability, Testability, Readability):**
    *   **Modularity:** Logic is encapsulated within the `AsciiArt` class. A private static method `_validate_common_inputs` centralizes validation logic, promoting the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
    *   **Reusability:** `draw_square` reuses the logic from `draw_rectangle`.
    *   **Testability:** Each drawing method is a pure function—its output depends only on its inputs. This makes them trivial to unit test.
    *   **Readability:** The code is documented with clear docstrings, uses descriptive variable names, and includes type hints as per modern Python standards.
*   **Reliability (Fault Tolerance):** The `_validate_common_inputs` method provides robust protection against invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer dimensions, multi-character symbols), raising appropriate built-in errors (`ValueError`, `TypeError`) to prevent runtime failures with bad data. This ensures the application is safe and predictable.
