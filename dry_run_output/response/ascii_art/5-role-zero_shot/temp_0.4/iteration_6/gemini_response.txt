Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a solution that emphasizes quality, maintainability, and adherence to best practices, in line with the ISO/IEC 25010 standard.

The following Python code defines an `AsciiArt` class for generating various 2D shapes.

### Key Quality Attributes (ISO/IEC 25010) Addressed:

*   **Functional Suitability:** The code correctly implements all specified drawing functions.
*   **Reliability (Maturity, Fault Tolerance):** Robust input validation is implemented using specific, built-in error types (`TypeError`, `ValueError`), ensuring the application handles invalid data gracefully.
*   **Performance Efficiency:** The implementation uses efficient string-building techniques (`list.append` followed by `str.join()`) to avoid performance issues associated with repeated string concatenation in a loop.
*   **Maintainability (Modularity, Reusability, Analyzability):**
    *   The code is encapsulated within a single, cohesive class (`AsciiArt`).
    *   Validation logic is centralized in private helper methods (`_validate_dimension`, `_validate_symbol`), promoting code reuse and making it easy to update validation rules in one place.
    *   Methods are pure functions where possible, simplifying testing and reasoning.
*   **Usability (Learnability, Operability):** The public API is clear, well-documented, and uses standard Python conventions, making it easy for other developers to learn and use.
*   **Testability:** The class structure and pure-function nature of the methods make them straightforward to unit test.
*   **Readability:** The code is formatted according to PEP 8 and includes clear variable names, type hints, and comprehensive docstrings for high readability and ease of understanding.
