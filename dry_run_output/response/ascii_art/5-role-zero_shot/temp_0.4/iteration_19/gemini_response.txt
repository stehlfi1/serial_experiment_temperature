Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a high-quality Python implementation for the ASCII art generator.

The following solution adheres to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard by focusing on:

*   **Functional Suitability & Correctness:** The code correctly generates the specified shapes according to the requirements.
*   **Reliability & Safety:** Robust input validation is implemented using a centralized helper method, preventing crashes from invalid data and ensuring predictable behavior.
*   **Performance Efficiency:** String generation uses efficient methods (`list.append` followed by `str.join`) to avoid performance degradation from repeated string concatenation.
*   **Maintainability & Modularity:** The logic is encapsulated within the `AsciiArt` class. A private helper method (`_validate_inputs`) centralizes validation logic, adhering to the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle.
*   **Usability & Testability:** The class-based structure and public interface are clear and easy to use or extend. Each method is a pure function (given the same inputs, it produces the same output), making them highly testable.
*   **Readability:** The code includes comprehensive docstrings, type hints, and descriptive variable names, making it easy to understand and maintain.

Here is the complete implementation:
