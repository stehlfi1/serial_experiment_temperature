Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a high-quality Python implementation for the ASCII art generator, focusing on the principles outlined in the ISO/IEC 25010 standard for software quality.

The code below emphasizes:
-   **Maintainability:** Achieved through a clear OOP structure, private helper methods for validation, and comprehensive documentation.
-   **Reliability:** Robust input validation prevents crashes and ensures predictable behavior.
-   **Functional Suitability:** Each function correctly implements the specified drawing logic.
-   **Performance Efficiency:** Uses efficient string operations (`.join()` on a list of strings) instead of repeated concatenation.
-   **Usability:** A clear and consistent API is provided through the `AsciiArt` class methods.

Here is the complete, well-documented Python code.

"""
ascii_art_generator.py

A Python module for generating 2D ASCII art shapes.

This module provides the AsciiArt class, which implements methods for drawing
various geometric shapes using ASCII characters. The implementation adheres to
high-quality coding standards, focusing on correctness, maintainability,
and reliability as per the ISO/IEC 25010 standard.
