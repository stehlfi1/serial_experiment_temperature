Of course. As a senior software developer focused on quality, I will provide a Python solution for the ASCII art generator that adheres to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard by emphasizing modularity, safety, readability, and correctness.

The solution will be encapsulated within an `AsciiArt` class. It includes robust input validation in a private helper method to ensure safety and maintainability (DRY principle). Each public method is clearly documented, explaining its purpose, parameters, return value, and potential errors, which enhances usability and testability. The core drawing logic uses efficient string operations and list comprehensions for good performance.

Here is the high-quality Python code for the console-based 2D ASCII art application.

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

A module for generating 2D ASCII art shapes.

This module provides the AsciiArt class, which implements methods to draw
various geometric shapes using ASCII characters. The implementation prioritizes
code quality, adhering to principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard, including
functional suitability, performance efficiency, reliability, and maintainability.
