Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a high-quality Python implementation for the ASCII art generator that adheres to the specified requirements and the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard.

The solution is encapsulated within an `AsciiArt` class, promoting modularity and reusability. A private helper method, `_validate_inputs`, centralizes input validation, enhancing maintainability and fault tolerance. Each drawing method is documented with clear docstrings, explaining its function, parameters, return value, and potential errors, which improves readability and testability. The algorithms for generating shapes are designed for both correctness and performance efficiency, using list comprehensions and `str.join()` instead of inefficient string concatenation in loops.

Here is the complete, high-quality Python code:

```python
"""
A module for generating 2D ASCII art shapes.

This module provides the AsciiArt class, which contains methods for drawing
various geometric shapes using text characters. The implementation prioritizes
code quality, adhering to principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard, including
functional suitability, performance efficiency, reliability, and maintainability.
