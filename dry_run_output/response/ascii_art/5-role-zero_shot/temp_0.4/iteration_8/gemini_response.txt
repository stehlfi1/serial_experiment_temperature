Of course. As a senior software developer, I will generate a high-quality Python implementation for the ASCII art application. The code will adhere to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard by focusing on maintainability, reliability, efficiency, and other key quality characteristics.

Here is the complete, well-documented, and testable Python code.

This module provides the AsciiArt class, which implements an interface for
