Of course. Here is a high-quality Python implementation for a console-based 2D ASCII art application, designed according to your specifications and adhering to the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard.

```python
"""
A module for generating 2D ASCII art shapes.

This module provides the AsciiArt class, which implements an interface for
drawing various geometric shapes using ASCII characters. The implementation
prioritizes correctness, maintainability, and safety by adhering to best
practices and including robust input validation.

This code is designed with the ISO/IEC 25010 standard in mind, focusing on:
- Functional Suitability: Correctly generates the specified shapes.
- Performance Efficiency: Uses efficient string operations.
- Reliability: Handles invalid inputs gracefully through fault tolerance.
- Usability: Provides a clear and easy-to-use class-based interface.
- Maintainability: Employs modular, readable, and well-documented code.
- Portability: Uses only standard Python libraries.
