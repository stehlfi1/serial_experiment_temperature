Of course. As a senior software developer, I will provide a high-quality Python implementation for the ASCII art generator, adhering to the specified requirements and the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard.

The solution is structured within an `AsciiArt` class, ensuring modularity and reusability. It includes robust input validation for safety and reliability, comprehensive docstrings for readability and maintainability, and efficient algorithms for performance.

A module for generating 2D ASCII art shapes.

This module provides the AsciiArt class, which implements methods to draw
various geometric shapes using ASCII characters. The implementation focuses on
code quality, adhering to principles of correctness, efficiency, safety,
