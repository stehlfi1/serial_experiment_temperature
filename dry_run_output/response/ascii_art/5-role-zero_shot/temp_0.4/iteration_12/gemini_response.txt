Of course. As a senior software developer focused on quality, I will provide a solution that is not only functional but also robust, maintainable, and well-documented, adhering to the principles of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard.

The following Python code defines an `AsciiArt` class with static methods for drawing various shapes. This design choice makes the class a stateless utility, meaning you don't need to create an instance of it to draw shapes, which simplifies its use (e.g., `AsciiArt.draw_square(...)`).

### Key Quality Attributes (ISO/IEC 25010) Addressed:

*   **Functional Suitability (Correctness):** Each method correctly generates the specified ASCII shape according to the requirements.
*   **Performance Efficiency:** The code uses efficient string operations like `str.join()` and list comprehensions instead of slow string concatenation in loops.
*   **Maintainability (Modularity & Reusability):**
    *   Input validation is centralized in a single private helper method (`_validate_input`), adhering to the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle.
    *   `draw_square` reuses the more general `draw_rectangle` method.
    *   The code is organized within a class, providing a clear namespace.
*   **Reliability (Maturity & Fault Tolerance):** The code is protected against invalid inputs by raising `ValueError` with descriptive messages, preventing unexpected behavior or crashes. This is a key aspect of "Safety".
*   **Usability (Operability):** The public API is clear, well-documented, and uses intuitive parameter names and type hints.
*   **Portability:** The code uses only standard Python libraries and should run on any platform with a Python 3 interpreter.
*   **Testability:** Methods are implemented as pure functions (output depends solely on input) that return strings, making them trivial to unit test.

Here is the complete implementation:
